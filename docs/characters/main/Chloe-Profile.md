# Chloe Martinez - Character Profile

## Core Identity
**Age:** 20  
**Current Status:** Santa Barbara City College student (officially), chronic non-attender (reality)  
**Goal:** Transfer to UCSB (increasingly impossible dream)  
**Secret Gift:** Tetrachromat - sees approximately 100 million colors vs normal 1 million

## The Tetrachromacy Experience (Unknown to Her)

### What She Sees But Doesn't Understand
- The "dirty" yellow of anxiety that pools around stressed students (actually 47 distinct shades of yellow-orange she has no names for)
- McConnell's Turkish Coffee ice cream has 23 different browns she can distinguish but calls them all "that perfect brown"
- State Street's red tiles contain a symphony of crimsons that make her dizzy (sensory overload misinterpreted as anxiety)
- Her mother's lipstick changes through 8 distinct coral phases as it fades (she thinks everyone notices this)
- The UCSB lagoon at sunset shows her 200+ distinct colors where others see maybe 30

### How It Manifests
- Constant "headaches" in fluorescent lighting (actually processing overhead from extra visual data)
- Can't explain why certain color combinations make her physically nauseous
- Obsessively arranges her few possessions by color gradients only she perceives
- Draws/doodles with impossible color precision but thinks she's "bad at art"
- Often closes eyes in overwhelming visual environments (Target, malls)

## The COVID Collapse

### Senior Year (2020)
**The Last Normal Day:** March 13, 2020
- Wore her favorite seafoam sweater (she sees 15 variations of seafoam in it)
- Had just been accepted to UC Merced, was holding out for UCSB waitlist

### The Bedroom Months
**March 2020 - June 2021**

- Actually spent days watching colors shift on her ceiling as sunlight moved

### The Discovery
**September 2022**

## Anxiety Architecture

- Believes her lies while telling them
- Forgets which version she told to whom
- Keeps a notebook of lies (encrypted in color codes only she understands)
- Lies to herself most of all

### Magical Thinking
- If she wears the same outfit as a "good day," it might happen again
- Certain color combinations are "lucky" or "cursed"

2. Puts on "going to class" outfit
3. Drives to SBCC
4. Sits in parking lot

- Colors in adult coloring books with uncanny precision

### Secret Spaces

- SBCC library study room 203 (never studies)
- Her car, parked at various viewpoints
- The bathroom at McConnell's (cries there regularly)

## Internal Monologue Patterns

### Unreliable Narrator Traits
- Time dilates in her memory (minutes become hours)
- Assigns malicious intent to neutral interactions
- Remembers conversations that didn't happen
- Forgets important events entirely
- Conflates dreams with reality

### Recurring Thoughts
- "Everyone knows I'm a failure"
- "I'll start fresh Monday" (every Thursday)
- "Maybe I have a brain tumor" (explains the colors)
- "If I could just transfer, everything would be fine"
- "I'm not lying, I'm protecting everyone"

### Color-Emotion Synesthesia
- Shame: Burnt sienna with purple edges
- Hope: That specific seafoam from her sweater
- Panic: Neon chartreuse pulsing
- Love: Coral gradient like Mom's lipstick
- Despair: The anti-color, like staring at the sun

## Relationships

### Lost Friend - Marisa Chen
- Best friend since 7th grade
- Actually at UCSB now
- Chloe ghosted her out of shame
- Still likes Chloe's old Instagram posts
- Represents the life Chloe should have had

### Online Friend - "AzureSkies94"
- Met in anxiety support Discord
- Only person she's honest with
- Doesn't know is actually her TA from dropped class
- Their chats are the only authentic thing in her life

### Crush - The Maintenance Guy (Hale)
- Noticed his hair is dyed (sees the different black tones)
- He's the only person without an anxiety color
- Watches him from library window
- Has assigned him an elaborate backstory
- Doesn't know his name

## The Paradox

She can see more colors than 99.9% of humanity but lives in a black and white world of success/failure. Her gift makes the world overwhelming, contributing to anxiety she medicates with isolation. She could be an extraordinary artist, designer, or scientist, but she's trapped in a bedroom, watching colors no one else can see, lying about a life she's not living.

## Story Arc Potential

### Act 1: Discovery
- Someone (Hale?) notices her unusual color perception
- Parents issue ultimatum
- Must actually attend classes or lose car/phone/room

### Act 2: Attempted Integration
- Forced proximity to Hale (group project?)
- Discovers his record collection includes colored vinyl variants she can differentiate
- Begins documenting her color perception
- Realizes she's not crazy, she's extraordinary

### Act 3: Revelation
- The tetrachromacy discovery
- Connection between overwhelming colors and anxiety
- Hale's legal troubles surface
- Choice: Hide in safety or step into her full spectrum

## Speech Patterns

### Verbal Tics
- Starts sentences with "So basically..."
- Overuses "literally" when lying
- Trails off mid-sentence when overwhelmed
- Describes things by colors others don't see
- Apologizes reflexively

### Sample Dialogue
"So basically, the professor said— well, not said exactly, but like, implied?— that the deadline was more of a suggestion. The board was that weird green, you know? Not mint but not sage, that in-between one that makes your teeth hurt? Anyway, I literally couldn't concentrate because this girl's highlighter was wrong. Not yellow-yellow but that acidic yellow that shouldn't exist. Sorry, what was the question?"

## Hidden Depths

### Unexpected Skills
- Perfect color memory (could be a sommelier, art authenticator)
- Intuitive understanding of color theory
- Can spot art forgeries without training
- Knows when produce is perfectly ripe by color
- Could revolutionize fields requiring color distinction

### Secret Interests
- Watches Korean makeover shows (for the color transformations)
- Collects paint chips from hardware stores
- Has 400+ photos of Santa Barbara sunsets
- Follows tetrachromacy research without knowing why
- Dreams in colors that don't have names

## The Truth Beneath

Chloe isn't lazy or deliberately self-destructive. She's a tetrachromat in a trichromatic world, experiencing constant sensory overload misdiagnosed as anxiety disorder. Her lies aren't malicious but protective, creating a buffer between her overwhelming reality and others' expectations. She's not failing because she's incapable, but because she's processing four channels of color information in a world built for three.

Her story is about discovering that what makes her different isn't a disorder to be hidden but a gift to be understood. The anxiety is real, but it's not the cause—it's the symptom of a brilliant mind trying to dim itself enough to fit in a world that's already too bright.
