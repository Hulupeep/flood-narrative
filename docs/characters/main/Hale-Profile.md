**To himself at 3am:** "Bathory recorded this in a garage. Just a garage. And it changed everything. Quorthon was twenty. Twenty. What have I done except collect other people's rebellion?"

**About Chloe (never said aloud):** "She arranges things by colors I don't think exist. Like she's tuning the world. I want to show her the Moonsorrow splatter vinyl. Seven colors. She'd see seventy."

## The Tragedy

Hale is brilliant, cultured, and deeply moral, but one purchase made from passion rather than politics destroyed his life. He's not a Nazi—he's a victim of his own obsessive completionism and the dangerous ambiguity of art separated from artist. He could be teaching ethnomusicology or running a museum archive, but instead he mops floors at night, the world's most educated janitor, hiding from a past that wasn't even real.

## Story Arc Potential

### Act 1: Invisible Collision
- Notices Chloe's color behavior
- Leaves her a colored vinyl in library
- She googles "VinylViking805"
- Finds the arrest story

### Act 2: Mutual Recognition
- She confronts him (she knows about being mislabeled)
- He explains the collection
- She can see colors in the vinyl he can't
- They start documenting record colors together

### Act 3: Redemption/Destruction
- Someone recognizes him on campus
- Viral post: "Nazi working at UCSB"
- Chloe's testimony about who he really is
- Choice: Run again or fight with truth

## The Core Wound

Hale's first taste of ownership—that unopened Bathory CD—created an insatiable need to be the first to experience something. This need led him to the Permafrost record, which poisoned everything it touched. Now he owns hundreds of "firsts" but can never unhear what they cost him. He's both collector and collected, categorized in a database he can't escape, preserved in digital amber as something he never was.

His story is about the price of passion without context, the danger of separating art from its intentions, and how a working-class kid's desperate grab for beauty pulled him into an ugly world he never knew existed. He just wanted to own something new, something his—and that very human desire destroyed his life.
