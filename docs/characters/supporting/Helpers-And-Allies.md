But also, ay Dios, we see what they don't throw away when they should. You holding onto something that's poisoning you, no? Is okay. Sometimes we need poison to make medicine. But first, you drink this chocolate. Too skinny, all of you kids."

Would you like some tea? The cup is that particular blue-green that shouldn't exist but does."

## These Helpers Form a Web

Each doesn't know about the others, but together they create an unconscious support network. Maria's chocolate, Tommy's friendship, Lars' unconditional love, Marcus's validation, Izzy's sanctuary, Raj's protection, and Astrid's potential truth—they're all holding pieces of salvation that Chloe and Hale must gather to become whole.

The beauty is that most help without needing recognition or thanks. They see pain and respond with quiet kindness, proving that healing happens in small moments of human connection, not grand gestures.
