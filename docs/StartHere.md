# The Orchestrated Literary Production Methodology
## A Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Creating Elevated Fiction

---

## üé≠ Core Philosophy
This methodology treats literary creation as a **discovery-driven collaboration** between human orchestrator and AI system, where each phase builds organically from the previous, with continuous human review ensuring artistic integrity and emotional truth.

**Key Principle**: The starting point doesn't matter‚Äîwhat matters is the systematic exploration and elevation of that seed into a complete, literary work.

## üå± PHASE 1: DISCOVERY (Exploration Without Judgment)

### Goal: Generate Raw Material
- **Starting Points** (any of these work):
  - A location (UCSB campus)
  - A character trait (tetrachromacy)
  - An object (metal rock)
  - A scene fragment (bathroom graffiti)
  - A "what if" question
  - An emotional truth

### Process:
1. **Free exploration** - AI investigates starting point from multiple angles
2. **Document generation** - Create character sketches, location maps, scene fragments
3. **Connection finding** - Look for unexpected links between elements
4. **NO PLOTTING YET** - Resist structure; just discover

### Outputs:
- Character profiles (rough)
- Location descriptions
- Scene fragments
- Thematic possibilities
- Interesting contradictions
- Unique elements (tetrachromacy + UV art)

### üéØ Orchestrator Checkpoint:
- Review discovered materials
- Identify most compelling elements
- Decide what to keep, what to explore further
- NO QUALITY JUDGMENT - just interest level

## üó∫Ô∏è PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE (Structure from Chaos)

### Goal: Create Narrative Framework

### Sub-Phase 2A: Genre/Mode Decision
- Review discovered materials through genre lenses
- Consider: Literary fiction? Romance? Thriller? Hybrid?
- Genre affects everything: pacing, stakes, resolution

### Sub-Phase 2B: Plot Structure
**Option 1: Jeff Kitchen's Reverse Cause & Effect**
- Start with desired ending emotion
- Work backward through causes
- Each scene must causally create the next
- Results in airtight plot logic

**Option 2: 22 Steps (Truby Method)**
- Map discoveries to story beats
- Identify: weakness ‚Üí need ‚Üí desire ‚Üí opponent ‚Üí plan ‚Üí battle ‚Üí self-revelation
- Ensures character transformation

### Sub-Phase 2C: Reading Sequence Design
- **Plot order** ‚â† **Reading order**
- Consider:
  - Starting in medias res
  - Dual timelines (flood/reunion)
  - Flashback integration
  - Information revelation timing

### Outputs:
- Story structure document
- Chapter/scene outline
- Timeline(s)
- Causal chain map

### üéØ Orchestrator Checkpoint:
- Approve structure
- Identify potential problems
- Suggest reordering if needed

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è PHASE 3: INITIAL DRAFTING (Bringing It to Life)

### Goal: Create First Chapters with Literary Techniques

### Process:
1. **Hook Development**
   - First line must compel
   - First page must establish voice
   - First chapter must create questions

2. **Power Move Application** (from powermoves.md):
   - **Privileged Perception**: What only this character sees
   - **Double-Encoded Scenes**: Surface + underneath meanings
   - **Free Indirect Style**: No filter verbs
   - **Causal Weave**: Because/therefore chains
   - **Kinetic Structure**: Rhythm and pace modulation

3. **Voice Establishment**
   - Each character's distinct speech patterns
   - Narrative voice consistency
   - Synesthetic descriptions for tetrachromat

### Chapter Production Cycle:
1. Draft chapter with techniques
2. Review against power moves
3. Check voice consistency
4. Ensure hooks/questions
5. Verify causal connections

### üéØ Orchestrator Checkpoint (Every 2-3 Chapters):
- Read for emotional impact
- Check if hooked as reader
- Verify voice feels authentic
- Suggest specific improvements

## üë• PHASE 4: EDITORIAL BOARD REVIEW

### Goal: Multi-Dimensional Quality Control

### The Editorial Board (from editors.md):

| Editor | Focus Area | What They Check | When Active |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Morgan (Continuity)** | Timeline/consistency | Dates, ages, names, facts | After each 5 chapters |
| **Casey (Voice)** | Character distinction | Dialogue authenticity, POV consistency | Throughout drafting |
| **Tara (Plot)** | Story structure | Causality, pacing, stakes | After full outline, mid-draft |
| **Paul (Style)** | Prose quality | Sentences, rhythm, beauty | During revision |
| **Val (Theme)** | Meaning/depth | Symbols, metaphors, resonance | After first full draft |
| **Chris (Hook)** | Reader engagement | Page-turning quality | Opening chapters, cliffhangers |
| **Theo (Emotion)** | Feeling/impact | Do scenes land emotionally? | Key scenes |
| **Logan (Location)** | Setting accuracy | Real places correctly depicted | Throughout |
| **Riley (Research)** | Factual accuracy | Tetrachromacy, Swedish, etc. | As needed |

### Editorial Process:
1. **Swarm Review** - All editors read simultaneously
2. **Issue Documentation** - Create EDITORIAL-CONCERNS.md
3. **Priority Matrix** - Rate issues by impact
4. **Systematic Fixes** - Address in order of importance

### üéØ Orchestrator Checkpoint:
- Review editorial findings
- Decide which issues to address
- May override editorial suggestions for artistic reasons

|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Objective Correlative** | External reflects internal | Rising water = rising emotion |
| **Significant Detail** | Small things carry weight | Seventeen warms |
| **Failed Witness Test** | Isolation through perception | Others can't see UV |
| **Synesthetic Prose** | Sense-blending descriptions | Colors that taste |
| **Symbolic Accumulation** | Repeated images gain meaning | UV messages |
| **Negative Space** | What's not said matters | Twenty months silence |
| **Fractal Structure** | Patterns repeat at every scale | Micro/macro searching |

### Surgical Precision Approach:
- Don't apply everywhere
