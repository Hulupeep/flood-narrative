Isolation Button
A **button with isolation** is a *last line* (of a beat, paragraph, or scene) that lands like a closing click **and leaves the POV character alone**—socially, physically, or epistemically. It’s short, often on its own line, and it seals the moment by naming (or implying) the gap between the character and everyone else.

## Why it works

* **Aftertaste:** White space + brevity = resonance.
* **Asymmetry:** Confirms the POV’s solitude or unique knowledge.
* **Momentum control:** Ends the beat decisively without over-explaining.

## How to write one

1. Build to a micro-test or choice.
2. Abort or fail the social proof.
3. Drop a **clean, concrete sentence** that marks aloneness. (≤ 8–10 words. No hedging.)

## Your stall-door example

Set-up: anomaly → almost-test →
**Button with isolation:** *Janice won’t see it.*

## Quick templates

* **Social:** *No one answers.* / *He won’t look.*
* **Mechanical:** *The camera won’t catch it.*
* **Cognitive:** *She remembers. They don’t.*
* **Moral:** *She’s the only one who says no.*

## Placement & form

* Put it **last**. Give it **its own line**. Use **periods**, not ellipses.
* Favor **specific nouns/verbs** over abstraction: *The photo’s blank.* (better than *It doesn’t work.*)

## Mini-checklist

* Concrete?
* Short?
* Final?
* Names the gap?

## Common pitfalls

* **Explaining the feeling:** *She feels very alone.* (flat) → *No one calls back.* (concrete)
* **Over-stacking drama:** keep it cool; let the white space do the work.
* **Vagueness:** pick one axis of isolation (social/mechanical/cognitive) and nail it.

Use one of these “buttons with isolation” per scene or two to keep the page humming with quiet charge.
