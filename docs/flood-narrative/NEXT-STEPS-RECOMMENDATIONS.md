# NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATIONS
## Moving from Complete First Draft to Query-Ready

---

## üìä CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

‚úÖ **Complete First Draft**: All 16 chapters written and revised
‚úÖ **Power Moves Applied**: Surgical techniques enhancing emotion
‚úÖ **Accuracy Fixed**: Storke Tower, timeline, character consistency
‚úÖ **Foreshadowing Added**: Holbrook properly seeded
‚úÖ **Character Voices**: Distinctive and consistent

**We're at 90% complete** - just need final polish and package

## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (In Order)

### 1. COMPILE COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT (30 minutes)
Create single document with all chapters in correct order:
- Use the verified chapter list from COMPLETE-FIRST-DRAFT-GUIDE
- Add chapter numbers and titles
- Include proper manuscript formatting
- Create both reading version and submission version

### 2. FINAL CONTINUITY READ (2-3 hours)
One complete read-through checking ONLY for:
- Name consistency (especially supporting cast)
- Number consistency (17, 93, 497)
- Timeline flow between chapters
- Location continuity
- Language inventions spelled consistently (havsdans, etc.)

### 3. OPENING HOOK POLISH (1 hour)
The first 5 pages are CRITICAL for agents:
- Chapter 1 opening with bathroom UV message
- Ensure tetrachromacy shown not told
- Hook must be immediate and visceral
- Consider if we need stronger first line

### 4. CLOSING RESONANCE CHECK (30 minutes)
- Does Chapter 16 exhibition scene pay off all promises?
- Is the ring with seventeen colors the right ending image?
- Should we add epilogue or is ending perfect as is?

### 5. CREATE QUERY PACKAGE (3-4 hours)

#### Query Letter Components:
- **Hook**: One-sentence concept
- **Synopsis**: 2-3 paragraphs of plot
- **Bio**: Author credentials
- **Comps**: 2-3 similar successful books
- **Word count**: ~70,000 words

#### Suggested Hook:
"When tetrachromat Chloe‚Äîwho sees 100 million colors where others see 3 million‚Äîmeets UV painter Hale during a catastrophic flood, they discover they've been unconsciously communicating through art only they can perceive."

#### Potential Comps:
- *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* (portal between worlds via art)
- *The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue* (invisible person finding connection)
- *Everything I Never Told You* (family dynamics with neurodivergent child)

#### First 10 Pages:
- Must be FLAWLESS
- Show voice immediately
- Demonstrate unique concept
- End on compelling moment

### 6. SYNOPSIS CREATION (2 hours)
- 1-2 page summary hitting major plot points
- Include ending (agents need to know)
- Focus on Chloe/Hale relationship arc
- Mention key supporting characters

### 7. SENSITIVITY READER CONSIDERATION
Before submission, consider getting reads for:
- Tetrachromacy/neurodivergence representation
- Mexican-American family dynamics
- Swedish immigrant experience
- Trauma/PTSD portrayal
- Flood survivor experiences

## üí° OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

### Consider Adding:
1. **Playlist/Soundtrack Notes**: Since music (vinyl) is important
2. **Art Portfolio**: Mock-ups of UV paintings/arrangements
3. **Website**: Author platform with tetrachromacy info
4. **Social Media**: Instagram showing color arrangements

### Research Opportunities:
1. **Agents who rep literary fiction with speculative elements**
2. **Agents interested in neurodivergent narratives**
3. **Small presses focusing on innovative fiction**
4. **Contests for literary fiction**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT NOT TO DO

### Avoid:
- Over-revising at sentence level (it's good enough!)
- Adding new plot threads
- Changing core concept
- Second-guessing the seventeen warms motif (it works!)

### Resist Urge To:
- Add more exposition about tetrachromacy
- Explain the UV art more
- Make the ending "bigger"
- Add unnecessary epilogue

## üìÖ SUGGESTED TIMELINE

**Week 1:**
- Day 1: Compile manuscript
- Day 2-3: Continuity read
- Day 4: Opening/closing polish
- Day 5-7: Query package creation

**Week 2:**
- Days 1-2: Synopsis writing
- Days 3-4: Agent research
- Days 5-6: Final polish
- Day 7: Begin submissions

---

## üéØ MY TOP RECOMMENDATION

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP**: Compile the complete manuscript into one document. This will:
1. Give you the satisfaction of seeing it whole
2. Reveal any flow issues between chapters
3. Allow accurate word count
4. Create submission-ready document
5. Enable final read-through

After that, the query letter is most important‚Äîwithout a great query, the manuscript won't get read.

## üåü CELEBRATE MOMENT

Before doing ANYTHING else:
- **You've written a complete novel!**
- **It's innovative and emotionally true**
- **The concept is genuinely unique**
- **The love story is earned**
- **The writing techniques are sophisticated**

This is a massive achievement. Take a moment to appreciate what you've created: a love story told in frequencies most people can't perceive, made visible through disaster and art.

## üöÄ FINAL THOUGHT

This manuscript is special because it:
- Makes readers FEEL tetrachromacy
- Turns disability into superpower
- Uses real location (UCSB) authentically
- Creates new language for love
- Transforms trauma into art
