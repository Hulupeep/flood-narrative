---

## üìä EDITORIAL TEAM CONSENSUS

**Overall Manuscript Status: 85% READY**
- Strong foundation with innovative techniques
- Emotional truth successfully prioritized
- Minor revisions needed for continuity
- Timeline requires spot corrections

---

## üö® PRIORITY 1: IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### 1. Timeline Conflicts (TARA)
**Issue**: Kiss timing inconsistency
- Chapter 7 states "2:15 AM"  
- Chapter 12 references "2:13 AM"
- **FIX**: Standardize to 2:15 AM throughout

**Issue**: Tower naming
- "Carillon Tower" vs "Storke Tower" used interchangeably
- **FIX**: Choose one (recommend Carillon for poetry)

### 2. Continuity Errors (CASEY)
**Issue**: Hale's age
- Sometimes implied 28, sometimes younger
- **FIX**: Confirm age 24 (closer to Chloe's 22)

**Issue**: Maria's knowledge
- Chapter 14 reveals she knew where both were
- Chapter 1 suggests she doesn't know Hale
- **FIX**: Subtle hint in Chapter 1 that Maria knows more

### 3. Plot Structure Gap (PAUL)
**Issue**: Holbrook appears suddenly in Chapter 16
- No foreshadowing of his threat
- **FIX**: Add 2-3 subtle mentions in earlier chapters
- Suggested spots: Chapter 3 (news article), Chapter 9 (gallery connection), Chapter 13 (Tommy mentions)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 2: CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENTS

### Voice Consistency (VAL)
**Issue**: Hale's Swedish patterns inconsistent
- Sometimes drops articles, sometimes doesn't
- **FIX**: Create consistent rules:
  - Drops articles in stress: "Going to gallery"
  - Keeps articles when calm: "Going to the gallery"
  - Inverts when emotional: "Always you see me"

**Issue**: Chloe's counting compulsion
- Very strong Chapters 1-5, fades later
- **FIX**: Add counting moments in Chapters 11, 13, 15

### Character Development (CHRIS)
**Supporting Cast Needs**:
- **Maria**: Add distinctive Spanish phrases beyond "mija"
- **Tommy**: More vinyl/music references in dialogue
- **Dr. Tanaka**: Scientific precision in speech patterns
- **Parents**: More specific Mexican-American cultural markers

- Tuesday afternoon kiss (Ch 11)

### Prose Achievements (LENA)
**Exceptional Techniques**:

- Kinetic structure for phone reading
- Zero filter verbs in revised chapters

**Best Prose Moments**:

## üåü UNANIMOUS EDITORIAL RECOMMENDATION

**Complete the surgical fixes and move to submission phase.**

This is not just another flood romance or neurodivergent narrative. This is something new: a love story told in frequencies most people can't perceive, made visible through art, disaster, and faith. The market is ready for this level of innovation paired with emotional authenticity.
