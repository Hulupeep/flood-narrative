## 4. HOLBROOK FORESHADOWING üé≠

### Add Subtle Mentions Before Chapter 16

**Chapter 3 Addition:**
Add when Chloe is researching UV paintings:
"A news article from last year catches her eye‚Äî'Gallery Owner's Son Cleared in Vandalism Case.' James Holbrook. The name means nothing to her. Yet."

**Chapter 9 Addition:**
During coffee meeting:
"The coffee shop has local art on walls. One piece has a gallery sticker: 'Holbrook Contemporary.' Hale's jaw tightens when he sees it, but says nothing."

**Chapter 13 Addition:**
When Tommy brings the vinyl:
"Tommy mentions, 'That Holbrook kid's been sniffing around, asking about Swedish artists. His dad owns galleries. Watch out for him.'"

## 5. MARIA'S KNOWLEDGE HINTS ü§´

### Subtle Additions to Show She Knows More

**Chapter 1 Fix:**
Change: "Maria doesn't know Hale"
To: "Maria's expression does something quick‚Äîrecognition?‚Äîbefore settling into concern."

**Chapter 8 Addition:**
"Maria's eyes flick between them with something like understanding, but she says nothing."

**Chapter 9 Addition:**
"Maria texts: 'Coffee went well?' How did she know there was coffee?"

## 7. CHLOE'S COUNTING COMPULSION üî¢

### Add to Later Chapters

**Chapter 11 Addition:**
"She counts while waiting for his answer‚Äîseventeen seconds. Always seventeen with him."

**Chapter 13 Addition:**
"Forty-three new words for colors. She can't not count. The compulsion stronger when creating."

**Chapter 15 Addition:**
"Twenty-seven ingredients in her mother's mole. She counts each one as mam√° explains."

## 8. HALE'S SWEDISH PATTERNS üá∏üá™

### Consistent Rules:

**When Stressed/Emotional:**
- Drops articles: "Going to tower" not "Going to the tower"

- Swedish words slip in: "Fan" (damn), "Nej" (no)

**When Calm:**

**When Intimate:**
