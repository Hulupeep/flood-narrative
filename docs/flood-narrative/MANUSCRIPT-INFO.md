## 📝 Synopsis

When tetrachromat Chloe—who sees 100 million colors where others see 3 million—meets UV painter Hale during a catastrophic flood at UC Santa Barbara, they discover they've been unconsciously communicating through art only they can perceive. Separated by evacuation and lost to each other for twenty months due to mistaken names, they continue creating art in parallel, each unconsciously responding to the other's invisible work. Their eventual reunion reveals that their connection transcends normal perception, proving that love can persist in frequencies others can't see.

## 📚 Reading Notes

The complete manuscript is ready for reading in `COMPLETE-MANUSCRIPT.md`. The story flows between past (flood night) and present (reunion), with the truth of their connection revealed through carefully placed clues about tetrachromacy, UV art, and the unique way they perceive each other.

The manuscript emphasizes emotional truth over technical explanation, using Chloe's unique perception as metaphor for how love creates its own private language between two people.
