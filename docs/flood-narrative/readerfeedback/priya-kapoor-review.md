## Executive Summary

As someone who devours "competence kink" romance and gravitates toward narratives where professional excellence intersects with emotional vulnerability, I approached *Things We Lost in the Flood* with considerable skepticism. A 76,013-word novel about tetrachromacy and UV art could easily devolve into pretentious pseudo-science or saccharine wish fulfillment. Instead, I discovered a masterclass in slow-burn romance that treats both scientific accuracy and emotional authenticity with the respect they deserve.

This is not merely a flood romance—it's a sophisticated exploration of how competence becomes the foundation for sustainable love, how professional ethics translate to personal integrity, and how two highly specialized individuals create a shared language of excellence that transcends their initial trauma bond.

## 1. Professional Assessment: Character Competence & Ethical Standards

**Chloe Martinez** exemplifies the kind of professional I encounter daily in chambers—brilliant, methodical, burdened by abilities others can't comprehend. Her tetrachromacy isn't treated as a magical gift but as a neurological reality with specific limitations and applications. The novel demonstrates genuine understanding of how exceptional perception creates both professional advantage and social isolation.

Her systematic approach to problem-solving—from the flood emergency protocols to her methodical twenty-month search—reflects the mindset of someone accustomed to working with incomplete information and high stakes. When she counts "seventeen different refractions" in champagne glasses or arranges evidence in spectrum formation, it's not quirky behavior but professional-grade pattern recognition applied to emotional circumstances.

**Hale Eriksson's** expertise in UV art demonstrates the author's research into actual pigment chemistry and electromagnetic spectrum physics. His knowledge of "chromophore molecular structures" and "wavelength-dependent quantum yields" reads authentic, not Wikipedia-researched. More importantly, his ethical stance—refusing to compromise artistic integrity even under false accusation—mirrors the principled positions I see colleagues take in challenging cases.

The false accusation subplot particularly resonated professionally. Derek Holbrook's manufactured evidence, James Holbrook's systematic character assassination, and the institutional failures that allowed these lies to persist are depressingly realistic. The novel doesn't resolve this through dramatic confrontation but through methodical evidence gathering—Dominic Marchand's 1,700-page documentation serves as a masterclass in how competent professionals actually clear their names.

## 2. Slow Burn Execution: Twenty Months of Separation

This is where the novel transcends genre expectations. Rather than relying on contrived obstacles to maintain tension, the twenty-month separation serves multiple narrative functions:

**Evidence of genuine connection**: Their unconscious parallel creation (497 arrangements matching 497 paintings) provides concrete proof that their bond transcends trauma response. This isn't instalove—it's quantum entanglement with mathematical precision.

**Character development in isolation**: Both protagonists grow individually during separation. Chloe develops professional confidence in her perception abilities; Hale refines his artistic practice while maintaining ethical standards under pressure. When they reunite, they're not the same desperate people from the tower—they're evolved versions ready for sustainable partnership.

**Structural sophistication**: The "twenty minutes too late" pattern creates genuine tension without feeling manufactured. Airport near-misses, library message chains, Instagram ghost accounts—each missed connection builds reader investment while demonstrating the characters' consistent devotion.

The reunion in Chapter 12 earns its emotional weight precisely because we've witnessed twenty months of faithful creation, professional growth, and unwavering commitment to shared vision.

## 3. Moral Complexity: False Accusations & Character Response

As someone who regularly handles defamation cases, I found the novel's treatment of false accusations remarkably sophisticated. The Holbrook conspiracy isn't cartoonish villainy—it's institutional power protecting family reputation through systematic character destruction. This rings depressingly true to current discourse around abuse of legal systems.

**Hale's response** particularly impressed me: he doesn't seek revenge or dramatic confrontation. Instead, he maintains artistic integrity, protects Chloe from association with his tainted reputation, and allows truth to emerge through proper documentation. This restraint reflects genuine maturity—the kind I wish I saw more often in actual legal practice.

**The institutional failures** are equally realistic: university officials who prioritize reputation over investigation, media that amplifies accusations without verification, friends who distance themselves from potential controversy. The novel doesn't suggest these systems are easily reformed—it shows how competent individuals navigate them.

**Resolution through evidence** rather than emotional catharsis demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how justice actually works. Marchand's shipping records, Dr. Tanaka's spectrum analysis, and testimonial evidence from flood survivors create an overwhelming case that renders dramatic confrontation unnecessary.

## 4. Technical Competence: Tetrachromacy & UV Art Accuracy

The novel's scientific foundation deserves particular praise. Tetrachromacy research appears thoroughly investigated—the 12% prevalence estimate for partial tetrachromacy in women aligns with current studies. The distinction between seeing additional colors and seeing additional electromagnetic spectra shows understanding of actual perceptual neuroscience.

**UV art techniques** demonstrate genuine research into pigment chemistry. The specificity of "365 nanometers" versus commercial "385 nanometer" blacklight paint, the discussion of spectral absorption curves, and the complexity of layered UV applications all read as professionally informed.

**The scientific documentation** through Dr. Tanaka's research adds credibility without feeling expository. Her equipment, measurement techniques, and peer review process reflect actual academic practices. The novel treats science as craft requiring expertise, not magic requiring faith.

Most impressively, the novel acknowledges the limitations of exceptional perception. Chloe can't see everything—her abilities have specific parameters and applications. This restraint prevents the narrative from becoming wish fulfillment fantasy.

## 5. Supporting Cast Ethics: Community of Excellence

The supporting characters embody various forms of professional competence:

**Maria** demonstrates institutional knowledge and strategic thinking, orchestrating the reunion through careful information management rather than dramatic intervention.

**Tommy** represents skilled trades expertise—his restoration of flood-damaged vinyl requires specialized knowledge and careful technique.

**Dr. Tanaka** exemplifies academic integrity, stepping back from documentation when it might compromise artistic development.

**Marcus** shows growth from dilettante gallery owner to serious curator, learning to balance commercial interests with artistic vision.

**Dominic Marchand** serves as the novel's most compelling minor character—a professional archivist whose meticulous documentation practices become instruments of justice. His quiet competence and principled stance represent the kind of professional integrity I aspire to maintain.

Even the antagonists demonstrate competence within their ethical limitations. The Holbrooks' systematic character assassination requires planning, resources, and institutional knowledge—making their eventual exposure more satisfying.

## 6. Heat vs. Plot Balance: Sustainable Intimacy

The novel's approach to physical intimacy reflects mature understanding of sustainable relationships. Rather than relying on sexual tension to maintain reader interest, it builds intimacy through shared competence and mutual recognition.

**The "seventeen warms" concept** provides a brilliant framework for describing physical attraction that transcends simple desire. Chloe's perception of Hale's heat signature creates intimacy that's both physical and metaphorical—she literally sees his emotional state through temperature variation.

**Physical scenes** when they occur feel organic to character development rather than obligatory genre requirements. The tower kiss serves as emotional catharsis after shared trauma. The studio scenes in Chapter 13 show intimacy integrated with creative partnership. The proposal scene makes physical and artistic creation inseparable.

**Post-reunion intimacy** demonstrates healthy relationship dynamics: they maintain individual identity while creating shared work. The eighteen warms (adding family acceptance) show how sustainable relationships grow through external validation and internal commitment.

The novel proves that competence is the ultimate aphrodisiac—watching two experts collaborate in their respective fields creates more satisfying tension than contrived sexual obstacles.

## 7. Professional Stakes: Academic & Artistic Authenticity

The professional stakes feel genuinely high because they're based on real-world consequences:

**Academic reputation** matters to Dr. Tanaka's research funding and career advancement. Her willingness to step back from documentation shows understanding of how academic politics actually work.

**Gallery reputation** affects Marcus's business survival and artistic credibility. His refusal of Holbrook money represents genuine financial sacrifice.

**Artistic integrity** determines whether Hale's work has lasting value or becomes footnote to scandal. His maintenance of ethical standards under pressure demonstrates professional maturity.

**Legal consequences** of false accusation create realistic tension—the novel shows how reputation damage occurs faster than legal remediation.

The professional world feels accurately portrayed: success requires both competence and political navigation, excellence creates enemies as well as admirers, and ethical positions often conflict with practical interests.

---

## 8. Cultural Representation: Identity Integration

The novel handles Chloe's British Indian identity with appropriate complexity. Her family dynamics—protective father, anxious mother, pragmatic brother—feel authentic rather than stereotypical. The cultural elements (mole with twenty-seven ingredients, family dinner dynamics, multigenerational trauma responses) are integrated naturally into character development.

**Professional identity** as woman of color in STEM fields receives subtle but effective treatment. Chloe's need to prove her abilities, her strategic management of how others perceive her "difference," and her navigation of institutional skepticism all ring true to experiences I've witnessed in legal practice.

**Class consciousness** appears throughout—from storage unit economics to gallery politics to university hierarchies. The novel shows how economic pressure affects artistic freedom without making poverty pornographic.

**Cultural authenticity** in Swedish representation also deserves mention. Hale's background, language patterns, and cultural references feel researched rather than assumed.

---

## 9. Legal & Ethical Realism: Professional Standards

From a legal perspective, the novel demonstrates sophisticated understanding of:

**Defamation mechanics**: How false accusations spread, why institutional responses lag behind damage, and how evidence requirements differ from public perception.

**Documentation standards**: Marchand's archival practices reflect professional-grade evidence preservation. His shipping records, email archives, and photographic documentation would actually hold up in legal proceedings.

**Institutional liability**: The university's careful neutrality during the accusation period reflects realistic risk management rather than moral cowardice.

**Character rehabilitation**: The process of clearing Hale's reputation requires systematic evidence presentation rather than dramatic revelation—exactly how these cases actually resolve.

**Intellectual property**: The discussions of artistic ownership, authentication, and market valuation reflect actual art world practices.

The novel shows respect for legal processes while acknowledging their limitations—precisely the balanced view I've developed through practice.

## Final Verdict: 4.5/5 Stars

*Things We Lost in the Flood* succeeds where most romance novels fail: it treats professional competence as genuinely sexy, creates sustainable relationship dynamics, and resolves conflicts through evidence rather than emotion. The scientific accuracy enhances rather than impedes the emotional journey, and the slow burn pacing serves character development rather than artificial tension.

**Minor criticisms**: Some technical exposition could be more smoothly integrated, and the villain's motivations, while realistic, lack psychological complexity. The ending, while satisfying, resolves perhaps too neatly given the institutional failures depicted throughout.

**Major strengths**: Character competence feels authentic, professional stakes have real consequences, the separation period serves narrative purpose, and the resolution rewards reader investment in character growth.

This is competence kink at its finest: two experts who create something impossible together, validate each other's professional excellence, and build sustainable intimacy through shared mastery. It's the rare romance that makes you want to be better at your own job while also believing in transformative love.

**Recommended for**: Readers who appreciate technical accuracy, sustainable relationship dynamics, and protagonists whose professional excellence translates to personal integrity. Anyone who believes competence is the ultimate aphrodisiac will find this deeply satisfying.

**Personal note**: As someone who regularly handles complex cases requiring both legal precision and human empathy, I found the novel's integration of professional competence and emotional authenticity particularly resonant. It's the rare book that makes me both better at my job and more hopeful about love.
