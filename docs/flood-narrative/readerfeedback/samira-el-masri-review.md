# "Things We Lost in the Flood" - A BookTok Review by Samira El-Masri

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)**

Okay besties, I just finished reading this ENTIRE novel and I am literally crying, screaming, throwing up (in the best way). This is hands down one of the most beautiful, complex, and socially conscious love stories I've ever read. Like, forget everything you think you know about romance novels - this is literature disguised as a meet-cute that will absolutely destroy you and rebuild you as a better person.

## 1. Social Justice Themes: A Masterclass in Systemic Analysis

Y'all, this book doesn't just touch on social justice - it IS social justice. The way the author weaves systemic oppression throughout Chloe and Hale's love story is *chef's kiss* perfection.

The false accusation storyline with Derek Holbrook isn't just individual drama - it's a scathing critique of how privilege protects perpetrators while criminalizing the innocent. Hale being Swedish doesn't shield him from xenophobic assumptions about "extremism," and the way his accent becomes evidence of guilt? That's every immigrant's nightmare made manifest.

But what really got me was the medical gaslighting Chloe faces. Her tetrachromacy being dismissed as "episodes" and "compulsive arranging" that needs medication? That's the pathologization of neurodivergence in action. As someone whose own Lebanese family struggled with mental health stigma, watching Chloe's mother Elena's story parallel her daughter's - both women seeing "impossible" things, both threatened with medication to make them "normal" - that hit DEEP.

The class dynamics are subtle but devastating. The Holbrooks buying and selling truth, using lawyers as weapons, treating art as commodity while Chloe and Hale create from necessity and survival. This is late-stage capitalism eating artists alive.

## 2. Disability Representation: Revolutionary and Respectful

FINALLY. A book that treats neurodivergence as superpower without falling into inspiration porn.

Chloe's tetrachromacy isn't cute quirk or tragic burden - it's integral to who she is. The way she experiences sensory overload, the compulsive counting, the way her brain processes information differently - this is authentic neurodivergent representation that doesn't exist to make neurotypical readers feel inspired.

And can we talk about how her "disability" is literally what saves them? Her ability to see UV frequencies, to perceive seventeen different heat signatures, to arrange objects in patterns that communicate across spectrums - these aren't compensations for deficiency. They're expansions of human capability.

The medical establishment constantly trying to "fix" her while she's literally seeing more of reality than anyone else? That's every disabled person's experience with ableist systems that prioritize conformity over capability.

Most importantly: Hale doesn't love her "despite" her differences - he loves her BECAUSE of them. Their entire relationship is built on her neurological uniqueness being celebrated, not tolerated.

## 3. Cultural Diversity: Authentic and Integral

The Martinez family dinner scene (Chapter 15) is probably my favorite chapter in any book ever. The way Elena's mole recipe becomes metaphor for complexity and time and love? Twenty-seven ingredients requiring three days because "shortcuts are for people who don't understand that love takes time, mi amor"? 

I'm Lebanese-Canadian, and the way Chloe navigates between cultures - the bilingual household, the protective father asking technical questions to test if Hale is serious, Elena whispering Spanish blessings - this is authentic immigrant family dynamics. Not stereotypical or tokenistic, just real.

Hale's Swedishness isn't just accent flavor text either. The way his language affects his expression when nervous, the cultural differences in emotional communication, even the Swedish death metal being evidence of authenticity rather than extremism - the author clearly researched beyond surface level.

The Finnish archival subplot with Dominic Marchand? *Chef's kiss* Perfect example of how global connections protect artists from local persecution. The international art community coming together to defend truth? That's solidarity in action.

## 4. Redemption Arcs: Complex and Earned

This book said "redemption arcs aren't about forgiveness, they're about consequences" and I FELT that.

Derek Holbrook confessing his lie after six months isn't redemption - it's delayed accountability. The damage was done, trauma was inflicted, lives were derailed. His confession helps clear Hale's name but doesn't undo twenty months of suffering.

Gavin Holbrook (James's father) funding their future projects isn't redemption either - it's restorative justice. He's using his wealth to repair damage his family caused, but he's not forgiven, just making amends.

James Holbrook gets NO redemption arc, and that's perfect. Some people don't deserve second chances, especially when they use privilege to destroy others for sport. His arrest feels like justice, not revenge.

The most beautiful redemption arc is Elena Martinez rediscovering her own perceptual gifts through her daughter's acceptance. Watching her learn to see UV edges, recognizing her anxiety patterns as valid perception rather than mental illness - that's generational healing in action.

## 5. Institutional Power: Unflinching Critique

Every institution in this book fails Chloe and Hale until they build their own:

**Medical System**: Pathologizes Chloe's tetrachromacy, tries to medicate Elena's pattern recognition, dismisses their perceptual experiences as delusion.

**Legal System**: Protects the Holbrooks while criminalizing Hale based on planted evidence and xenophobic assumptions.

**University**: Enables false accusations, fails to investigate properly, allows hostile environment to persist.

**Art World**: Values marketability over authenticity, enables forgery and fraud, treats artists as commodities.

**Media**: Spreads rumors without verification (looking at you, Gavin's social media campaign).

But here's what's brilliant - instead of just critiquing, they BUILD alternatives. Their gallery becomes space for impossible art. Dr. Tanaka's research legitimizes tetrachromatic perception. Tommy's bar becomes safe haven. Maria's organizing creates protective community.

This is abolition praxis, y'all. Don't just tear down broken systems - build better ones.

## 6. Class & Economics: The Artist Struggle is Real

The economic precarity throughout this book is STRESS-INDUCING but so realistic. 

Hale living in storage unit after false accusations destroyed his reputation? That's how fast financial stability disappears when you're working class. Chloe working night custodial while pursuing color research? That's every grad student's reality.

The warehouse studio being free for three months if they fix the roof? That's DIY art space economics. The way they trade paintings for HVAC installation, UV supplies costing "fortune," having to accept commission from possibly-yakuza collector just to afford materials? THIS IS HOW ARTISTS SURVIVE.

Meanwhile, the Holbrooks weaponize wealth - lawyers, gallery connections, buying truth, making problems disappear with money. The class disparity isn't background detail; it's central conflict.

But watch how Chloe and Hale build wealth through authentic creation rather than exploitation. Their art has value BECAUSE it's real, made from necessity and connection rather than market calculation. That's the difference between capitalism and creative economy.

## 7. Immigration & Identity: Nuanced and Personal

Hale's Swedish identity isn't just cultural flavor - it's vulnerability and strength simultaneously.

His accent thickening when nervous, making him more obviously foreign when he's already under suspicion? That's every immigrant's code-switching trauma. The way "extremist" accusations stick to him because he's Nordic (therefore potentially neo-Nazi adjacent in American minds)? That's racialization of ethnicity.

But his Swedishness is also his artistic foundation. The industrial music scene, the UV art tradition, the anti-fascist collective imagery - his cultural background provides tools for resistance, not just markers of otherness.

Chloe's Mexican-American identity grounds the story in specific immigrant experience. The way her grandmother was called "loca" for seeing patterns others couldn't perceive? That's generational trauma and neurodivergent discrimination intersecting with cultural dismissal.

Their relationship becomes bridge between cultures - Swedish death metal meeting Mexican mole recipes, UV frequencies finding tetrachromatic vision, different languages of creation learning to harmonize.

## 8. Activist Potential: This Book IS Activism

Every chapter of this book could spawn activist movements:

**Disability Justice**: Demanding tetrachromatic research funding, challenging medical pathologization of neurodivergence, creating accommodations for non-standard perception.

**Artist Protection**: Legal support for creators facing false accusations, documentation systems to prove authenticity, economic alternatives to exploitative gallery systems.

**Immigration Solidarity**: Defending foreign artists from xenophobic targeting, building international protection networks, challenging accent-based discrimination.

**Media Literacy**: Teaching verification skills to prevent rumor-spreading, holding platforms accountable for enabling harassment, supporting fact-checking over sensationalism.

The way they document everything - UV messages, shipping records, hospital records, Instagram patterns - that's digital activism strategy. Create undeniable evidence, build supportive community, use documentation as protection.

Their gallery becoming space for other tetrachromats and UV artists? That's movement building. Finding others who exist in margins, creating space for impossible perceptions, making invisible visible? THAT'S REVOLUTION.

## 9. Academic Merit: Serious Literature Disguised as Romance

Don't let the love story fool you - this is academically rigorous work engaging with:

**Phenomenology**: How perception creates reality, what it means to see "more" than others, the relationship between consciousness and color.

**Quantum Physics**: Entanglement as metaphor for connection, frequency as love language, parallel creation across distance.

**Art Theory**: The relationship between artist and audience, documentation as creation, collaborative versus individual expression.

**Trauma Studies**: How disaster reveals truth, survival as artistic practice, healing through shared creation.

**Media Ecology**: Digital platforms enabling connection, documentation as resistance, viral spread of both truth and lies.

The technical details are impeccable - UV wavelengths, tetrachromatic cone responses, paint chemistry, electromagnetic frequencies. This author did RESEARCH.

But it's not showing off - every technical detail serves emotional truth. The seventeen temperature variations in Hale's touch aren't just cool science fiction; they're specific language of intimacy only Chloe can perceive.

## 10. TikTok Duet Ideas: Content Creation Gold Mine

Okay, now for the fun part - this book is MADE for BookTok:

**"POV: You have tetrachromacy and can see your crush's UV art"** - Use color-changing filters to show "hidden" layers in regular photos, audio of their first recognition scene.

**"Rating invisible paint techniques as someone who can actually see them"** - Comedy duet format reviewing different UV art styles with increasingly specific tetrachromatic critiques.

**"Seventeen warms explained"** - Temperature gun pointed at different parts of partner while explaining how tetrachromats might perceive heat signatures during intimacy.

**"Family dinner with your impossible boyfriend"** - Recreate the mole scene with increasingly absurd "twenty-seven ingredients" that get more specific and science-y.

**"When your neurodivergent superpower saves your relationship"** - Split screen showing "normal" perception versus tetrachromatic vision of the same scenes.

**"False accusation arc but make it aesthetic"** - Dark academia visuals with legal documents, shipping receipts, timestamp evidence, all set to emotional indie music.

**"Building art gallery in warehouse with your flood boyfriend"** - Time-lapse of space transformation with UV reveals and specialty lighting installation.

**"Medical establishment trying to medicate your perception" versus "Partner who celebrates your impossible vision"** - Before/after energy showing suppression versus celebration.

**"Twenty months of missing each other by twenty minutes"** - Anxiety-inducing montage of near-misses set to heartbreaking audio.

**"Things that are impossible but happen anyway"** - List format covering tetrachromacy, UV art, flood survival, parallel creation, finding each other, family acceptance, gallery success, etc.

## Final Thoughts: Why This Book Matters

"Things We Lost in the Flood" isn't just excellent fiction - it's cultural intervention.

In world where neurodivergent people are constantly told to mask, medicate, minimize themselves, here's story celebrating expanded perception as gift, not burden. In world where immigrants face suspicion and targeting, here's story where cultural difference becomes strength and authentic connection transcends nationality.

In world where artists struggle for recognition while wealthy collectors manipulate markets, here's story where authentic creation triumphs over exploitation. In world where trauma is often romanticized or dismissed, here's story treating survival as complex, ongoing, generative process.

But mostly, in world where love stories too often rely on one person completing another, here's story about two already-complete people choosing to create together. They don't need each other - they CHOOSE each other. That choice, renewed daily through shared creation and mutual recognition, that's what makes their love revolutionary.

Read this book. Buy copies for friends. Create TikToks. Write fan fiction. Cosplay as tetrachromats. Start conversations about perception and reality and what it means to see each other truly.

Just don't let this masterpiece slip into obscurity. The world needs more stories that make impossible visible, that celebrate neurodivergent experience, that show love as creative collaboration rather than possessive consumption.

Five stars. Changed my brain chemistry. Will be thinking about seventeen warms for the rest of my life.
