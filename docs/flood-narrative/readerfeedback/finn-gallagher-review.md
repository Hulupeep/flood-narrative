# Things We Lost in the Flood: A BookTok Review
*By Finn Gallagher, Galway's Rainbow Reads*

Right, lads. Settle in with a proper cup of tea because we need to have a chat about this book that's after leaving me completely wrecked in the best possible way. "Things We Lost in the Flood" has just destroyed every romance I've read this year, and that's saying something because I've been through more sapphic novels than you can shake a hurley stick at.

## The Bookseller's Eye: Market Appeal (9.5/10)

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, this book is going to sell like mad. I'm talking "queued around the block on publication day" kind of selling. Here's why:

**The hook is bloody brilliant**: Woman who sees impossible colors meets man who paints invisible art during a flood. Like, how do you NOT pick that up? It's got that "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" energy - utterly mad premise that somehow works perfectly.

**CrossGenre appeal**: This isn't just romance, though it's fierce romantic. It's literary fiction, it's speculative, it's got disaster elements, it's got art world drama. I can hand-sell this to the literary snobs AND the romance readers, which is rare as hen's teeth.

**BookTok goldmine**: The visual elements alone will have TikTok going mental. UV paint? Tetrachromacy? Invisible art? I can already see the aesthetic videos with blacklights and color theory. Plus the found-family dynamics and the trauma healing arc? Chef's kiss.

## Irish Perspective: Cultural Resonance (8.5/10)

Now, this is set in California, not County Cork, but there's something deeply Irish about this story that had me nodding along like a mad thing. It's that Catholic understanding of mystery made manifest, yeah? The idea that some people see more, feel more, experience the world in frequencies others can't perceive.

Chloe's relationship with her family - especially the mother who was medicated for seeing "too much" - that's every Irish family that's ever had someone a bit different. We understand that dance between protecting and smothering, between loving someone fiercely and not quite knowing how to handle their gifts.

And Hale being the immigrant, the outsider trying to find belonging? That resonates here too. Ireland's full of people who've come from elsewhere, bringing their own ways of seeing the world. The way he holds onto his Swedishness while adapting to American life - I see that in my shop every day.

The one thing that might not translate perfectly to Irish readers is the American university system and some of the social dynamics around campus life. But the core emotional truth? That translates everywhere.

## Queer Themes: LGBTQ+ Representation (7/10)

Here's where I wish the book had gone a bit further, and I say this as someone who's been advocating for queer stories in this town since before it was fashionable.

The good: The found family elements are pure queer energy. Maria, Tommy, Marcus - they're chosen family in the best way. The book understands that for many of us, our real family is the one we build, not the one we're born into.

Chloe's experience of being "too much," of seeing things others can't, of being pathologized for her differences - that's deeply queer even if it's not explicitly so. The whole arc of learning to embrace what makes you different rather than hiding it? That's every coming-out story ever written.

The missed opportunity: This could have been explicitly queer and it would have been even more powerful. Chloe's tetrachromacy as metaphor for queer identity works, but imagine if it wasn't just metaphor? The themes are all there - just needed to take that final step.

That said, as an allegory for queer experience, it's bloody brilliant. I'll be hand-selling this to questioning teens and anyone who's ever felt like they see the world differently.

## Literary Merit: Beyond Genre (9/10)

Right, this is where the book really shines. It's not just good romance or good speculative fiction - it's good literature, full stop.

**The language**: Gorgeous without being flowery. The author knows when to use scientific precision and when to let the poetry flow. The sections where Chloe describes her synesthesia? Absolutely stunning.

**The structure**: Eighteen chapters plus interstitials, moving between perspectives and time periods without ever losing the thread. The way it builds to the reunion is masterful - I was properly holding my breath.

**The themes**: Perception as reality. Art as communication. Love as recognition. The way trauma can both destroy and reveal. This book is thinking about big things while never forgetting to entertain.

**The research**: Someone did their homework on tetrachromacy, UV art, and color theory. It never feels like a Wikipedia dump - it's woven in naturally.

## Dialogue & Banter: Voice Authenticity (8.5/10)

The dialogue crackles. Each character has a distinct voice - Chloe's precision, Hale's slightly formal English, Maria's warmth, Tommy's working-class directness. The banter between Chloe and Hale never feels forced or performative.

Minor niggle: Some of the supporting characters occasionally sound a bit too similar, especially in the university scenes. But the main relationships? Pitch perfect.

The Swedish accent representation is particularly well done - Hale's English thickens with emotion, which feels authentic rather than stereotypical.

## Emotional Complexity: Trauma & Healing (10/10)

This is where the book absolutely soars. The trauma isn't just backstory - it's living, breathing reality that affects how the characters move through the world.

Chloe's hyper-vigilance about being "too much." Hale's learned invisibility. The way they both protect each other even when they can't find each other. The book understands that healing isn't linear and that love doesn't cure trauma - it just makes it bearable to carry.

The twenty-month search sequence could have been repetitive, but instead it shows how hope and despair can coexist. Both characters keep creating, keep believing, even when they have no proof the other exists.

## Setting Authenticity: Santa Barbara for International Readers (8/10)

I've never been to California, but this feels real. The author captures the specific energy of a university town, the way flood trauma lingers in a community, the dynamics of the art world. The setting supports the story rather than overwhelming it.

The details feel lived-in: the coffeeshops, the galleries, the way light moves through the warehouse where they create. As someone who reads a lot of American fiction, this feels authentic to place.

## Handselling Potential: Customer Recommendations (10/10)

This is where I get properly excited. I can think of seventeen different customers I'd recommend this to immediately:

- **The romance readers**: "It's like 'The Time Traveler's Wife' but with art instead of time travel"
- **The literary fiction crowd**: "Think 'Never Let Me Go' but hopeful"
- **The art lovers**: "You know how you feel when you see a painting that seems to glow from within? That's this book"
- **The neurodivergent community**: "It's about someone whose brain works differently and finding love that celebrates rather than tolerates that difference"
- **Anyone dealing with family trauma**: "It's about healing without forgetting, loving without losing yourself"

I'd put this in the window with a display of colored pencils and fairy lights. Maybe commission some UV-reactive artwork from local artists. This book begs for an event.

## Festival Circuit: Author Event Worthiness (9/10)

Oh, this author needs to come to Ireland. The themes would play brilliantly here - we understand mystery, we understand art as communication, we understand the importance of stories that preserve truth.

Perfect for:
- **CÃºirt International Festival of Literature** (the Galway connection would be perfect)
- **Mountains to Sea dlr Book Festival** (they love genre-crossing work)
- **West Cork Literary Festival** (intimate setting for discussing the craft)

The visual elements of the story would make for stunning presentations. Imagine readings with UV lights and color projections!

## Shelf Life: Rereadability & Giftability (9.5/10)

This is absolutely a rereader. The first time through, you're desperate to know if they find each other. The second time, you catch all the parallels, the way their unconscious creation mirrors each other. I spotted things on my second read that I completely missed the first time.

**Perfect gifts for**:
- Art students and artists
- Anyone in a long-distance relationship
- People fascinated by synesthesia or unusual perception
- Book clubs that like discussion-worthy reads
- Anyone who's ever felt misunderstood

The hardcover will be gorgeous - I'm already imagining cover designs with UV-reactive elements.

## Final Verdict: 9/10

"Things We Lost in the Flood" is the kind of book that reminds you why you fell in love with reading in the first place. It's ambitious without being pretentious, romantic without being saccharine, intellectual without being cold.

It's not perfect - I wanted more explicit queerness, and some secondary characters could be more developed. But Christ, when it works, it absolutely soars.

This is going straight onto my "Best of Year" list, and I'll be shouting about it to anyone who'll listen. It's the kind of book that creates readers - people will finish this and immediately want more like it.

**Bottom line**: Buy it. Read it. Give it to everyone you know who believes in impossible things. This is special.
