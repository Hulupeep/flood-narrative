## The Tea ☕

Y'all. Y'ALL. I stayed up until 4 AM reading this and then immediately texted my book club because we NEED to discuss this masterpiece. "Things We Lost in the Flood" is giving me all the feels and I'm not even mad about it.

## 1. Social Media Authenticity 📱

**This is IT, folks.** The way this author handles social media feels *real* - not like those books where characters post perfectly curated captions that no actual human would write. When Chloe arranges objects and posts them to Instagram without knowing why, when she's unconsciously creating content that matches Hale's art... that's some next-level digital age romance.

The Instagram posts throughout their separation? The way they're unknowingly creating a conversation across platforms? Chef's kiss. As someone who manages socials for a living, this representation of how we actually use these platforms - compulsively, unconsciously, as extensions of our internal worlds - is SPOT ON.

**Viral potential:** The concept of seeing someone's "true colors" literally? The UV art that's invisible until the right moment? The seventeen different temperatures when they touch? This book is basically made for aesthetic posts and color theory content. I can already see the BookTok compilations.

## 2. Healing Romance 💕

Listen, I am TIRED of books where trauma just magically disappears because of love. This ain't that. Chloe and Hale both carry their wounds - from the flood, from family rejection, from being misunderstood their whole lives. But they don't "fix" each other. They create space for each other to exist fully.

The way Hale paints what he can't see because he trusts Chloe's eyes? The way Chloe finally has someone who doesn't try to medicate away her differences? That's not codependency - that's partnership. That's what healing looks like when you find your person.

**Real talk:** The therapy scenes where they question if it's trauma bonding? The way they test their connection in "normal" circumstances? THAT is mature relationship writing.

## 3. Urban Creative Scene 🎨

As someone living in Chicago's art scene, this representation hits different. The warehouse spaces, the found family of artists, the way creativity becomes survival... it's authentic without being romanticized.

Marcus running a gallery in board shorts? Tommy salvaging vinyl from disaster? These feel like people I know. The way artists support each other, document each other's work, create community around impossible things... that's real. That's how we survive and thrive.

The flood survivors becoming chosen family? The way trauma creates bonds that outlast the initial crisis? I've seen this in activist spaces, in art communities, in places where people gather to make beauty from broken things.

## 4. Meme-Worthy Moments 😂

- "Everything about us is impossible. Doesn't make it not real." (MOOD)
- Chloe counting seventeen of everything obsessively
- Hale trying to pronounce Spanish words and failing adorably  
- The Finnish vinyl archivist who keeps receipts better than the FBI
- "Normal is boring. Impossible is where love lives." (From their CHILD. Icon.)
- Aurora seeing through time like it's no big deal
- The UV paint marriage rings that only they can see
- "Frequency-bonded" instead of engaged

**BookTok gold:** The scene where they paint over his precious first painting of her to test if their love is real? The drama! The symbolism! The trust! It's giving main character energy.

## 5. Chemistry Balance ⚖️

The physical chemistry is *chef's kiss* but it's the intellectual connection that really gets me. Two people who see the world differently finding someone who not only believes them but actively participates in their reality? That's intimacy.

The way they create art together - her arrangement, his painting, their combined frequencies making actual light? It's fantastical but grounded in real emotion. The heat signature thing sounds impossible until you remember that everything about love feels impossible when it's real.

**Steam level:** Just right. Passionate without being gratuitous. The focus stays on emotional and creative connection.

## 6. POV Content Potential 📹

This book is MADE for content:

- **Color theory videos:** "What would you see with tetrachromacy?"
- **Art tutorials:** UV painting techniques, arrangement photography
- **Relationship content:** "Signs you're quantum entangled with your person"
- **Science content:** The actual facts about tetrachromacy and perception
- **Aesthetic videos:** Seventeen different ways to arrange objects
- **Music content:** The flood playlist, vinyl collecting
- **Architecture content:** The Storke Tower, campus spaces

The visual potential is endless. Plus the science is real enough to spark actual educational content.

## 7. Nonprofit Perspective 🌍

As someone working in nonprofit arts education, I'm here for how this book handles:

- **Accessibility:** Making art accessible to people with different perceptions
- **Representation:** Neurodivergent characters who aren't stereotypes
- **Community building:** The institute they create for "impossible perception"
- **Documentation:** The importance of archiving overlooked stories
- **Funding:** Even touching on how guilty money (Holbrook) can fund good work

The Mellanrum Institute becoming a real school where kids learn to trust their impossible perceptions? That's the kind of institutional change we need.

## 8. Black Character Representation 👑

**Here's where I need to be real:** This book centers white characters, and that's just facts. But the secondary characters of color who do appear aren't stereotypes or tokens. Sarah (Black woman who survives the flood with her daughter) gets her own arc. The international students at the institute represent diverse experiences.

**Could be better:** More central characters of color, deeper exploration of how race intersects with being "different," representation in the chosen family.

**What works:** The universal themes of being misunderstood, finding your people, using art for survival - these resonate across communities.

## 9. Highlighting Passages 📖

**For the group chat:**

> "You're surrounded by art you'll never perceive. Beauty you'll never access. Colors you'll never— 'Prove it.'"

**For inspiration:**

> "We painted over everything from flood. Made it better. Made it present instead of past. Made it Monday instead of emergency."

**For crying:**

> "You're not invisible. You're just waiting for someone who sees your spectrum. They exist."

**For hope:**

> "Some things exist beyond explanation. Some connections create their own physics. Some love makes new spectrums visible."

**For the vision board:**

> "Everything impossible." "Together?" "No other way."

## 10. Brunch Book Club Recommendation 🥂

**BRING THIS TO YOUR NEXT BOOK CLUB.** 

**Discussion questions that will start fights (good fights):**
- Is their connection supernatural or just neurodivergent love?
- Would you want to see in 100 million colors if it meant feeling isolated?
- How do we support people whose realities we can't perceive?
- Is the school they create realistic or fantasy fulfillment?
- What does it mean to be "impossible" in a world that demands normal?

**Perfect for groups who loved:** The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Klara and the Sun, The Time Traveler's Wife, Red: A History of the Redhead

**Content warnings:** Flood trauma, family rejection, mental health themes, false accusations

**Brings:** Bottomless mimosas and emotional devastation. Plan accordingly.

## Final Thoughts 💭

This book said "what if love was literally visible?" and then delivered a story about finding your frequency in a world that can't see what makes you special. It's about chosen family, impossible art, and the kind of love that creates its own physics.

Will I be posting aesthetic videos inspired by Chloe's arrangements? Obviously.  
Will I be researching actual tetrachromacy? Already started.  
Will I be recommending this to every artist, creative, and hopeless romantic I know? You bet.

**For my nonprofit friends:** This is what arts education could look like.  
**For my creative friends:** This is what community looks like.  
**For my BookTok friends:** This is what viral content looks like.

Go read it. Then come find me so we can scream about it together.

*P.S. - If anyone knows any UV artists in Chicago, I need to see this magic in person. For... research purposes. Obviously.*
