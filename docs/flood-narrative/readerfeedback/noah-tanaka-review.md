# Things We Lost in the Flood - Reader Review

## Five Stars - "Bloody hell, this book destroyed me in the best way"

Right, so I just finished this absolute unit of a novel at 3AM with tears streaming down my face while my flatmate probably thinks I've lost it completely. *Things We Lost in the Flood* is the kind of book that makes you question everything you thought you knew about love, art, and what it means to truly *see* someone.

### 1. Found Family Vibes (11/10 - Would adopt this entire cast)

The found family in this book hits different. It's not the usual "quirky misfits become chosen family" trope - it's more like "people who exist in the margins finding each other through impossible circumstances." Tommy with his rescued vinyl and protective energy, Maria orchestrating reunions while pretending not to, Marcus learning that survival can become art, Dr. Tanaka stepping back to let love happen - even Dommo flying in from Finland with his seventeen hundred pages of documentation just to defend truth. 

The way they all protect Chloe and Hale without being asked, how they become a network of believers in invisible frequencies - mate, it's the kind of community we all wish we had. When Elena tells Hale to take care of Chloe's "beautiful but heavy" colors, or when Roberto starts asking technical questions about wavelengths because engineers don't interrogate delusions - that's family choosing to expand their understanding of reality because love demands it.

### 2. Music & Art Integration (10/10 - Synesthesia goals)

As a muso myself, the way this book treats art as a living, breathing language between people absolutely floored me. Hale's UV paintings aren't just invisible art - they're love letters, confessions, messages in a frequency only Chloe can read. And her tetrachromatic arrangements aren't compulsions - they're responses, conversations, proof of existence.

The vinyl subplot is *chef's kiss* - using Bathory death metal as the key to recognition, the water-damaged records creating accidental remixes, the shipping errors that connect Helsinki to Santa Barbara. When Chloe identifies albums by their UV spiral patterns rather than sound, when music starts having color in her perception - this is synesthesia porn for anyone who's ever experienced that crossover between senses.

The whole concept of "497 paintings for C" matched by 497 arrangements is just... how do you even write parallel artistic conversations happening unconsciously across twenty months? Genius.

### 3. Humor & Voice (9/10 - Australian approved)

The humor in this book sneaks up on you. It's not trying to be funny - it just captures those absurd moments that happen when impossible people try to live normal lives. "Is that titanium dioxide or just existential dread?" "Seventeen-millimeter wrench" as a unit of measurement in their private language. Chloe's dad counting Hale's temperature zones from across the yard like he's monitoring a fever.

Marcus in board shorts at gallery openings, Tommy calling them "the miracle couple" while delivering beer and vinyl, Hale's Swedish accent getting thicker when he's nervous ("Is perfect, ja?") - it's the kind of humor that comes from character, not punchlines.

Though honestly, the funniest bit might be James Holbrook thinking he can steal art that exists in frequencies he literally cannot perceive. The audacity.

### 4. Queer Rep (8/10 - Beautifully understated)

This isn't explicitly queer, but mate, the whole premise is about people who exist outside normal perception, who find love through frequencies others can't see, who build community in the margins. The found family of artists, archivists, flood survivors, and tetrachromats reads pretty bloody queer to me.

Plus there's something inherently queer about being told you're delusional for experiencing reality differently, then finding someone who not only believes your experience but creates art to make it visible to others. The way Chloe's family learns to accept her "impossible" vision through Hale's paintings feels like every coming-out story where love teaches people to expand their definition of normal.

### 5. Melbourne vs Santa Barbara Setting (7/10 - Missing the laneway energy)

As a Melbourne boy, I was obviously hoping for more coffee culture and street art, but Santa Barbara works for this story. The campus setting during flood, the warehouse studios in the Funk Zone, the beach scenes where UV paint glows in moonlight - it's got that Southern California art scene vibe where anything seems possible if you're alternative enough.

That said, I kept imagining how much better this would be set in Fitzroy with proper coffee and some Brunswick Street galleries. The flood could've been the Yarra during one of those freak storms, the tower could've been the State Library, and Tommy's bar would definitely be somewhere on Smith Street.

But honestly, the setting works because it's less about place and more about the spaces between - the basement library, the abandoned tower, the warehouse studio. Liminal spaces where impossible things can happen.

### 6. Audiobook Potential (11/10 - Would listen obsessively)

Holy shit, this needs to be an audiobook yesterday. Get someone with a proper Swedish accent for Hale (maybe Alexander Skarsg√•rd if he does audiobooks?), someone who can handle Chloe's technical color descriptions without making them sound clinical. 

The way voices merge when they're painting together, the free indirect discourse, the way their private language develops - this would be incredible in audio. Especially if they got creative with sound design for the UV painting scenes, maybe subtle electronic frequencies underlying Hale's sections.

Plus imagine the family dinner scene with Elena's Spanish, Roberto's architect precision, David's protective interrogation - that needs proper voice acting to capture the dynamics.

### 7. DIY/Underground Scene Authenticity (9/10 - Recognizes the real ones)

The art world politics in this book feel spot-on. The Holbrooks representing institutional gatekeeping, the gallery system that values visibility over vision, the way real artists support each other against frauds - this author knows the scene.

Tommy rescuing Hale's vinyl collection, Marcus organizing the flood survivor reunion, the Finnish archivists flying in to defend an artist they've never met - that's the underground network in action. When the establishment tries to destroy you, the community rallies.

The warehouse studio setup, trading HVAC work for paintings, the way they build their exhibition from scratch - that's proper DIY culture. No grants, no institutional support, just people who believe in impossible art making space for it to exist.

### 8. Romantic Chemistry (10/10 - New relationship goals unlocked)

Forget meet-cutes, this is a meet-impossible. Two people who exist in different spectrums finding each other during disaster, creating a shared language through frequencies only they perceive - that's romance that transcends the physical world.

The "seventeen warms" concept alone is relationship goals. Imagine loving someone so completely you recognize them by temperature variations. The way they count each other's heat signatures, create art in response to each other's emotions, develop private measurements ("seventeen-millimeter" as a unit of touch) - this is intimacy at a molecular level.

And it's not just romantic - it's sustainable. When it becomes eighteen warms after family acceptance, when they paint their trauma together instead of around it, when they choose Monday afternoon love over emergency intensity - that's how you know it's real.

### 9. Foodie/Coffee Culture (6/10 - Needs more coffee detail)

Elena's mole with twenty-seven ingredients is proper food love - the kind of cooking that takes three days because shortcuts are for people who don't understand that love takes time. The way she counts each ingredient like Chloe counts everything else, how the family recipe becomes acceptance ritual - beautiful.

But as a barista, I needed more coffee detail. Hale makes Swedish coffee "strong enough to dissolve spoons" but that's about it. Where are the grind notes? The extraction times? The way different roasts might look different to Chloe's tetrachromacy?

Though I did love the detail about Chloe's mug (stolen from UCSB Physics) filled to exactly her preferred level. That's proper coffee relationship knowledge right there.

### 10. Bookmarkable Lines (12/10 - Screenshot everything)

This book is quotable as hell. Every other page has something that made me stop and reread:

*"Love doesn't require visibility."*

*"We're problems. Our existence is problem. Our art is problem. Our love is problem. Beautiful problems."*

*"Everything about us is impossible. Doesn't make it not real."*

*"Creation always finds its match."*

*"We do impossible things. Create impossible art. Have impossible connection."*

*"Loved correctly. By someone who paints what he can't see because he trusts your eyes."*

The whole book is written in this frequency where every line feels essential, where you want to send screenshots to everyone you know who's ever felt too much or seen too much or loved someone who exists outside normal perception.

## Final Thoughts

This book wrecked me in ways I didn't expect. It's a love story, sure, but it's also about what it means to be believed when your experience doesn't fit normal categories. About finding your people in the margins. About making art that proves you exist even when the world can't see you.

Reading this as someone who's always felt a bit off-frequency from mainstream culture, who finds family in dive bars and record shops and late-night conversations about impossible things - mate, this hits every note. It's the book I didn't know I needed about people I recognize in my bones.

Would recommend to: Anyone who's ever felt too much, seen too much, or loved someone the world doesn't understand. Perfect for fans of weird literary fiction, synesthesia stories, found family dynamics, and absolutely devastating love stories that somehow end happy.

Content warnings: Flood trauma, false accusations, family mental health struggles, twenty months of searching for someone who might not exist, and the kind of love that makes you believe in impossible frequencies.

**Rating: 5/5 stars and approximately seventeen different emotional breakdowns**

*Read in two sittings because I literally couldn't put it down. Currently planning to buy copies for everyone I know who believes in invisible art and impossible connections.*
