## üéØ CORE STORY ELEMENTS

### The Premise:
Two people unknowingly communicating through art‚Äîshe arranges objects in patterns only tetrachromats can see, he paints in UV frequencies invisible to most‚Äîfind each other during catastrophic flood, lose each other in rescue, then spend twenty months searching while unconsciously continuing their conversation.

### The Theme:
Love as recognition of invisible selves; connection that transcends normal perception; what we find when we lose everything else.

### The Central Metaphor:
Tetrachromacy (seeing impossible colors) = seeing people as they really are
UV painting (invisible art) = expression that waits for the right audience
The flood = disaster that reveals what was always there

## ‚úçÔ∏è NARRATIVE TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED

### Successfully Integrated:
1. **Privileged Perception**: Failed witness tests create isolation
2. **Seventeen Warms**: Physical recognition through temperature
3. **Causal Chain**: THEREFORE/BUT structure throughout
4. **Surgical Precision**: 1-2 techniques per scene maximum
5. **Free Indirect Style**: Voices merge when in sync
6. **Kinetic Structure**: Short paragraphs for phone reading
7. **Double-Encoded Scenes**: Surface + underneath meanings

### Avoided:
- Excessive synesthesia
- Repetitive failed tests
- Over-explaining tetrachromacy
- Mechanical cause-effect
- Filter verbs
