# EDITORIAL CORRECTION - LOCATION ACCURACY

## ❗ IMPORTANT CORRECTION TO MASTER EDITORIAL BOARD

### Tower Naming - CORRECTED
**WRONG**: "Carillon Tower" 
**CORRECT**: **STORKE TOWER** (actual UCSB location)

### Accurate Usage:
- **Storke Tower**: The 175-foot brutalist tower, tallest structure on UCSB campus
- **Carillon room**: The room at the top of Storke Tower containing the 61-bell carillon
- **Storke Plaza**: The open area at the base with the koi pond

### Why This Matters:
- UCSB readers will immediately recognize Storke Tower
- It's an iconic campus landmark
- The carillon bells are a famous feature OF Storke Tower
- Using the real location adds authenticity

### Revised Fix for Manuscript:
**Standardize throughout to:**
- "Storke Tower" when referring to the building
- "The carillon room" when they're trapped at the top
- "The bells" or "carillon bells" when referencing the sound

### Example Corrections:
- ~~"Carillon Tower"~~ → "Storke Tower"
- ~~"In the tower"~~ → "In Storke Tower" or "In the carillon room"
- ✓ "The carillon bells rang" (correct - the bells are IN Storke)

### Additional UCSB Location Verifications:
- ✓ Davidson Library (correct)
- ✓ Campus Lagoon (correct)
- ✓ UCen (correct)
- ✓ The Arbor (correct)
- ✓ Campus Point (correct)

This correction supersedes the Master Editorial Board recommendation about tower naming. We must use the actual UCSB location names for authenticity.
