# TIGHT PLOT SUMMARY: "Things We Lost in the Flood"
## A Love Story in Invisible Frequencies

---

## ONE-PAGE THEREFORE/BUT STRUCTURE

**September 17, 2024:** Chloe discovers fresh UV paint messages in a bathroom stall—messages only her tetrachromatic eyes can see. BECAUSE she's been unconsciously responding to similar messages for months through pattern arrangements, THEREFORE someone knows about her impossible vision, BUT she doesn't know who's creating them, THEREFORE she must risk conscious contact at the library where "the water began."

**Flashback - January 9, 2023:** BECAUSE Chloe's tetrachromacy overwhelms her with 100 million colors no one else sees, THEREFORE she stays isolated on campus during winter break, BUT a massive flood traps her in Storke Tower with fourteen strangers. BECAUSE the power fails at 8 PM, THEREFORE emergency UV lights reveal hundreds of invisible paintings on the walls—paintings only she can see. 

**The Tower:** BECAUSE she can see the UV art, THEREFORE she meets Hale, a Swedish maintenance worker who's been painting invisible messages for three years, hoping someone with the right eyes would find them. BECAUSE they realize they've been having an unconscious conversation through art, THEREFORE they connect deeply during eight hours facing death. BUT the water keeps rising, THEREFORE at 2:15 AM they kiss like it's ending.

**Separation:** BECAUSE different helicopters rescue them at 6:47 AM, THEREFORE they're separated without contact information. BECAUSE their names were recorded wrong (Lars Holmström, C. Matthews), THEREFORE twenty months of searching fails. BUT both continue creating—Hale painting UV messages, Chloe arranging patterns—THEREFORE maintaining an unconscious conversation neither fully understands.

**Present - Reunion:** BECAUSE fresh UV messages appear on campus, THEREFORE Chloe returns to investigate. BECAUSE the patterns match her arrangements exactly, THEREFORE she realizes someone's been responding to her unconscious communications. BUT she fears it's trauma-induced delusion, THEREFORE she tests the connection at a coffee shop. BECAUSE Hale still registers as "seventeen different temperatures" to her synesthesia, THEREFORE their connection is verified as real, not trauma bonding.

**Collaboration:** BECAUSE their combined abilities are unprecedented (her tetrachromatic vision + his UV art), THEREFORE they create revolutionary art that makes invisible frequencies visible. BUT they have no language for what they're creating, THEREFORE they invent new vocabulary: havsdans (sea-dance), mellanrum (space between), frekvenskärlek (frequency love).

**Crisis:** BECAUSE their collaborative art gains attention, THEREFORE a public exhibition is planned. BUT James Holbrook (who falsely accused Hale years ago) tries to steal credit for their work, THEREFORE they must publicly claim their truth. BECAUSE the exhibition demonstrates art only possible through their unique connection, THEREFORE their love is validated as real, not delusion.

**Resolution:** BECAUSE their story proves that impossible connections exist, THEREFORE they found the Mellanrum Institute to teach others about expanded perception. BECAUSE human vision is still evolving, THEREFORE their daughter Aurora is born seeing through time itself, proving that love transcends current human perception.

## THE EMOTIONAL ARC

**ISOLATION → RECOGNITION → CONNECTION → SEPARATION → PARALLEL CREATION → REUNION → VALIDATION → EVOLUTION**

A woman who sees too much finds a man who paints in invisible light. Disaster brings them together, bureaucracy tears them apart, but their unconscious conversation through art continues across twenty months of separation. When they finally reunite, they must prove their connection transcends trauma by creating art that makes the invisible undeniably visible.

**Core Truth:** Love exists in frequencies beyond normal perception, but catastrophe can make it visible—if we're brave enough to look.
