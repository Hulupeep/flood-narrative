## ‚ùå CRITICAL STORY-BREAKING ISSUE (MUST FIX)

### Chapter 1: Tetrachromacy Naming Violation

**LOCATION:** Chapter 1, multiple instances
**VIOLATION:** Explicitly names "tetrachromacy" before Chapter 4 revelation
**IMPACT:** Destroys mystery structure fundamental to reader engagement

**SPECIFIC VIOLATIONS FOUND:**
- Direct use of term "tetrachromatic eyes"
- Scientific explanation of four-cone vision
- Explicit description of genetic mutation

**REQUIRED FIX:**
Replace ALL scientific terminology in Chapter 1 with experiential descriptions:
- ‚ùå "tetrachromatic eyes" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "impossible eyes"
- ‚ùå "four-cone vision" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "seeing seventeen different shades where others see one"
- ‚ùå "genetic mutation" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "the way she's always seen"

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
The power of Chapter 4's revelation depends on readers discovering WITH Chloe what makes her different. Chapter 1 must show her experience without naming it, maintaining the mystery of why she sees differently.

## üéØ EDITORIAL VERDICT

### READY FOR PUBLICATION AFTER ONE FIX

This manuscript represents exceptional literary achievement in speculative romance. The unique premise of tetrachromacy and UV art creates a fresh metaphor for invisible connection that resonates both literally and symbolically. The scientific grounding prevents the fantastical elements from feeling arbitrary while the emotional truth makes the impossible feel inevitable.

**CRITICAL PATH TO PUBLICATION:**
1. Remove ALL tetrachromacy terminology from Chapter 1
2. Review Chapter 1 for any remaining scientific explanations
3. Verify mystery structure intact through Chapter 4 revelation
4. Final proofread for the minor timeline consistencies
5. PUBLISH

### WHY THIS BOOK MATTERS

"Things We Lost in the Flood" does something rare in contemporary fiction: it makes the invisible visible without destroying the mystery. It respects both science and magic, proving they're not opposites but different frequencies of the same truth. The love story feels both impossible and inevitable‚Äîexactly what great romance should be.

The novel speaks to anyone who has ever felt like they see the world differently, love differently, or exist in frequencies others don't perceive. In our current cultural moment of increasing neurodiversity awareness, this story arrives at the perfect time.

### FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**PUBLISH WITH CONFIDENCE** once the Chapter 1 tetrachromacy naming is fixed. This novel has the potential to create its own subgenre: scientific magical realism, or perhaps "frequency fiction." It will find readers among:
- Romance readers seeking unique premises
- Literary fiction readers who enjoy speculative elements  
- Neurodivergent readers seeing themselves represented
- Artists and creators who understand invisible communication
- Anyone who believes love transcends normal perception

**Editorial Sign-Off:** APPROVED pending critical fix
