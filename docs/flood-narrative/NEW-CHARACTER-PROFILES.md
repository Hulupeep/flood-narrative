## ðŸ”— CHARACTER INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### How They Fit the Story
**Gavin represents:** How small actions (filming accident) become big harm (rumor campaigns)
**Dommo represents:** How meticulous care (documentation) provides salvation (evidence)

### Dialogue Philosophy Compliance
Both characters maintain "fumbling toward understanding":
- **Gav:** Fumbles toward justifying harm he's caused
- **Dommo:** Fumbles toward explaining complex shipping procedures

### Power Moves Enhancement
- **Privileged Perception:** Only Chloe sees UV evidence Dommo provided
- **Double-Encoded Scenes:** Gav performs concern while causing harm
- **Failed Witness Tests:** Others can't see what documentation proves

### Causal Chain Integration
```
BECAUSE bike incident (Gav films)
â†’ THEREFORE rumor spreads (Gav investigates)
â†’ BECAUSE harm escalates (community targeted)  
â†’ THEREFORE pressure on Chloe (friends warn)
â†’ BECAUSE shipping error (Dommo's mistake)
â†’ THEREFORE evidence exists (Dommo's records)
â†’ BECAUSE documentation complete (professional pride)
â†’ THEREFORE truth provable (public clearing)
```

### Story Bible Compliance
- **No early tetrachromacy naming:** Both characters learn about it only when others do
- **Supporting character function:** Each advances plot, not just observes
- **Consequence-driven:** Every action creates specific results
- **Emotional truth:** Personal motivations drive choices, not plot needs

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
