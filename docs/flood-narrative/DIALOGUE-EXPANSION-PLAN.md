## üó£Ô∏è CHARACTER VOICE PROFILES (Casey's Analysis)

### CHLOE MARTINEZ
**Current Strengths:**
- Synesthetic descriptions ("Your voice tastes purple-metallic")
- Compulsive counting ("Seventeen, always seventeen")
- Scientific precision mixed with emotion

**Needs Development:**
- Code-switching between family and academic settings
- How she talks when overwhelmed by color
- Her attempts to explain the inexplicable

**Signature Phrases to Develop:**
- "I can see it but I can't name it"
- "The color is approximately..." (then gives impossible description)
- "Seventeen" (as response to any "how many?")

### HALE LINDQVIST
**Current Strengths:**
- Swedish article dropping when stressed
- Careful, artistic descriptions

**Needs Development:**
- Swedish phrases bleeding through in emotion
- Artist's vocabulary for impossible things
- How he describes what he "almost sees"

**Signature Patterns:**
- Questions that are really statements: "You see them?"
- Swedish word followed by English translation
- Describes emotions as colors despite not fully seeing them

### MARIA (Best Friend)
**Completely Underdeveloped - Needs:**
- Knowing subtext (she suspects more than she says)
- Protective friend voice
- Spanish phrases when emotional
- "I knew it!" energy when truth revealed

### DR. LINDQVIST (Hale's Mother)
**One phone call isn't enough - Needs:**
- Scientific authority voice
- Swedish-American hybrid speech
- Mother's concern bleeding through professionalism
- "I've been looking for you" (someone like Chloe) for decades

### CHLOE'S PARENTS
**Almost silent - Need:**
- Mother's recognition of her own condition in Chloe
- Father's protective incomprehension
- Sibling dynamics
- Spanish-English family dinner flow

## üí¨ DIANA'S DIALOGUE EXPANSION TARGETS

### CHAPTER 7: THE KISS SCENE
**Currently:** "I've been looking for you" / "So have I"  
**Needed:** The fumbling toward confession

```
EXPANDED APPROACH:
HALE: "There's Swedish word‚Äî"
CHLOE: "Tell me."
HALE: "F√§rgsj√§l."
CHLOE: "Which means?"
HALE: "Color-soul. Person who sees same colors you see."
CHLOE: "That's not a real word."
HALE: "I made it up. Three years ago. For whoever was answering my paintings."
CHLOE: "You made up a word for me before you met me?"
HALE: "I made up seventeen words for you."
CHLOE: "Tell me another."
HALE: "Ljusv√§n."
CHLOE: "Light-friend?"
HALE: "Light-twin. Same light, different eyes."
```

### CHAPTER 8: SEPARATION MORNING
**Currently:** All internal monologue  
**Needed:** Chaos conversations

```
RED CROSS VOLUNTEER: "Name?"
CHLOE: "Chloe Martinez, but I need to find‚Äî"
VOLUNTEER: "Your family's been notified. Medical?"
CHLOE: "I'm fine, but there was someone‚Äî"
VOLUNTEER: "Boyfriend?"
CHLOE: "I... we just... his name is Hale‚Äî"
VOLUNTEER: "Last name?"
CHLOE: "Lind... Lindquest? Lindqvist? Swedish‚Äî"
VOLUNTEER: "No one by that name in our system."
MARIA: (arriving) "Chloe! Oh my god, your parents‚Äî"
CHLOE: "Maria, help me. Tall, Swedish, paint under his fingernails‚Äî"
MARIA: "Slow down. Who?"
CHLOE: "I can't explain. But I need to find him."
```

### CHAPTER 9: COFFEE SHOP REUNION
**Currently:** Quick recognition, immediate understanding  
**Needed:** Testing if real

```
CHLOE: "Is this about the research?"
HALE: "What research?"
CHLOE: "Tetrachromacy. You said you researched‚Äî"
HALE: "No. Not about research."
CHLOE: "Then why did you want to meet?"
HALE: "You know why."
CHLOE: "I need to hear you say it."
HALE: "Because I painted five hundred invisible messages and you saw them."
CHLOE: "Four hundred ninety-seven."
HALE: "You counted?"
CHLOE: "I count everything."
HALE: "What number am I?"
CHLOE: "Seventeen. Always."
```

### CHAPTER 11: TESTING IF REAL
**Currently:** Summary of experiments  
**Needed:** The actual testing dialogue

```
DR. TANAKA: "Describe what you see when you look at him."
CHLOE: "Seventeen distinct temperature zones‚Äî"
DR. TANAKA: "Be specific."
CHLOE: "His thumb runs 98.7, index finger 97.9, middle‚Äî"
HALE: "She's memorized my temperatures?"
CHLOE: "You painted my pencil arrangements from October."
DR. TANAKA: "This is unprecedented. Dual perceptive bonding."
CHLOE: "Is that real?"
DR. TANAKA: "You tell me. Can you see his paintings?"
CHLOE: "All of them."
DR. TANAKA: "Can anyone else?"
CHLOE: "No one."
DR. TANAKA: "Then it's real."
```

"The paintings are f√∂r dig‚Äîfor you."

When stressed:
"Vatten‚Äîwater everywhere‚Äîcan't‚Äî"

"Du √§r mitt ljus. You are my light. No‚Äîmore than light‚Äî"

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS METRICS

Dialogue expansion succeeds when:
1. Each character has distinct speech patterns
2. Conversations reveal plot/emotion more than narration
3. Subtext operates on multiple levels
4. "Failed witness" pattern reinforces isolation
5. Love develops through actual conversation

---

## üé¨ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**From Diana:** "Make them talk like people falling in love during disaster‚Äîinterrupted, overlapping, desperate to be understood."

**From Casey:** "If I can't tell who's speaking without tags, the voice isn't distinct enough."

**From Morgan:** "Every dialogue exchange should advance plot, reveal character, AND develop relationship. Triple duty."

**The Bottom Line:** This manuscript has beautiful narrative voice and stunning sensory description. What it needs is human conversation‚Äîmessy, real, revelatory. Let these characters speak their impossible love into existence.
