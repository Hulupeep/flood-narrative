# Wrong Names
*January 10, 2023, 7:30 AM - Red Cross Emergency Station*

## Part 1: Different Worlds

Different tents. Different colors. Different worlds.

Chloe stands in Red Cross Station B, still wrapped in someone else's blanket that smells like someone else's disaster—cigarette smoke and fear-sweat and something medicinal. Through the tent flap, she can see Station A—where they took him. Maybe. If he made it down. If another helicopter came. If, if, if.

"Name?"

Third time they've asked. Third time she's answered. Third time they write it wrong.

"Chloe Martinez." She spells it. "M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z."

"Age?"

"Twenty-three. Listen, I was in Storke Tower with—"

"We have you logged." The volunteer—name tag says BRENDA—doesn't look up from her clipboard. "Storke Tower, rescued 6:47 AM. Solo evacuation."

"Not solo. There were fifteen of us. There was someone—a man—Swedish—"

"Sweetie, I need you to focus. Medical conditions? Injuries?"

"I'm fine. But the Swedish man—tall, blonde, paint under his fingernails—"

"Are you hurt?"

"No, but—"

"Next of kin?"

"My parents, but they're fine, they're in Ventura. Please, I need to find—"

"Maria Martinez is looking for you. Your sister?"

"My friend. Where is she?"

"Station C. But you need to finish processing—"

Chloe's already moving.

---

## Part 2: Maria's Arrival

"CHLOE!"

Maria slams into her like a small hurricane, crying and laughing simultaneously. "Oh my god, I thought—when they said Storke Tower flooded—Jesus, Chloe, I thought you were dead."

"I'm okay. I'm—Maria, I need your help."

"You're shaking." Maria pulls back, studies her. "And you're—different. What happened?"

"There was someone. In the tower. We—"

"Chloe Elena Martinez, where the HELL have you been?" Another voice. Angry. Scared. 

Her cousin David, still in his pajamas, clearly drove here straight from bed.

"The tower—"

"Your parents are losing their minds. Your mom's having a breakdown. She keeps saying something about colors?"

"David, please, I need to find someone—"

"You need to call your mother."

"My phone's dead. Water."

"Use mine." He shoves it at her.

"In a minute. First I need—"

"Chloe." Maria's using her careful voice. "Who do you need to find?"

"His name is Hale. Hale Lindqvist. Swedish. He was in the tower with me."

"Your boyfriend?" David asks.

"No. Yes. I don't—it's complicated."

Maria and David exchange looks.

"How long have you been dating this guy?" David demands.

"Five hours."

"What?"

"We met during the flood. But also before. Kind of. Through art. It's—I can't explain right now. I just need to find him."

"Chloe." Maria takes her shoulders. "You're in shock. You're not thinking clearly."

"I'm thinking more clearly than ever. He sees—" She stops. Can't explain about the UV, the tetrachromacy, the seventeen warms. "Please. Just help me look for him."

---

## Part 3: The Lists

She finds the board where they're posting names.

*Station A Arrivals - Updated 8 AM*

"Help me look," she begs Maria. "Hale Lindqvist. Or maybe Lars—"

"Lars?"

"His middle name maybe? Or—shit, what if they wrote it wrong? Swedish names—"

"Chloe, breathe."

She scans. No Hale. No Lars. No Lindqvist. No Holstrom—wait, why is she looking for Holstrom?

But there—handwritten addition at bottom:
*Swedish male, 20s, no ID*

Her heart does something impossible—stops and races simultaneously. 

"That's him!" She grabs the nearest volunteer. "The Swedish male—where is he?"

"Transferred to County Medical. Hypothermia."

"When?"

"Twenty minutes ago."

Twenty minutes. Always twenty minutes too late.

"I need to get to County Medical."

"Roads are closed, honey. Emergency vehicles only."

"Then I'll walk."

"It's six miles and half of it's flooded."

"I'll swim."

"Chloe, stop." Maria grabs her arm. "You can't swim to the hospital."

"Watch me."

"This is crazy. You don't even know if it's him."

"It's him."

"How do you know?"

"I just—I know. Seventeen reasons I know."

"Seventeen? That's weirdly specific."

"Everything about him is seventeen."

---

## Part 4: The Phone Call Attempts

David's phone in her hand. She doesn't know Hale's number. Of course she doesn't. They were too busy drowning and kissing and seeing impossible colors.

"Information? I need a number for Hale Lindqvist. L-I-N-D-Q-V-I-S-T."

"City?"

"Santa Barbara. Or—maybe Uppsala? Sweden?"

"No listing under that name."

She tries variations:
"Lars Lindqvist?"
"H. Lindqvist?"
"Hale Marcus?"

Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

"The university. He's maintenance staff."

"UCSB has no employee by that name."

Because he's invisible. Always has been. Ghost painter. Ghost person. Ghost everything except to her.

"Chloe, honey." A new voice. Older. She looks up—Red Cross coordinator, badge says JANET. "I heard you're looking for someone from the tower."

"Yes! Swedish, about six-two, green eyes—"

"We have several unidentified evacuees. If you could look at photos—"

"Yes. Please."

Janet pulls out a tablet. Swipes through images. Unconscious faces on gurneys. Water-pale. Some breathing tubes. All strangers.

"None of these."

"These are all the males, 20-30, from tower rescues."

"He's not here."

"Then he might be at Station A or—"

"Or dead." David says it flat. "He might be dead, Chloe."

"He's not dead."

"How do you know?"

"Because I can still—" Feel his seventeen warms? See UV paint pulsing? Taste the kiss in frequencies? "I just know."

---

## Part 5: Wrong Names Everywhere

Maria finds a volunteer with a laptop, convinced them to search.

"Spell it again?"

"L-I-N-D-Q-V-I-S-T. Or try L-I-N-D-K-V-I-S-T. Or—"

"Nothing. But we have a Lars Holstrom?"

"That's—maybe? Try it."

The volunteer types. "Lars Holstrom, 24, evacuated from..." She squints. "Anacapa Hall. Not the tower."

Not him. But why does Holstrom sound familiar?

"What about partial names? Just 'Swedish'?"

"We don't search by nationality."

"Please. He's tall, blonde—"

"You've described half of UCSB."

"Paint. He had paint under his fingernails. UV paint."

The volunteer looks at her strangely. "UV paint?"

"It's—never mind."

---

## Part 6: Marcus and Emma

"Chloe?"

She spins. Marcus and Emma from the tower, wrapped in matching Red Cross blankets.

"You made it!" Emma runs to her. "We thought—when you went first—the helicopter—"

"Did you see him? After I left? Did Hale—"

"The Swedish guy?" Marcus nods. "He went in the second helicopter. Maybe five minutes after you."

"Which hospital?"

"I don't know. They were splitting between County and Cottage."

"Did he say anything? Before he left?"

Emma and Marcus exchange glances.

"He was...agitated," Emma says carefully. "Kept saying something in Swedish."

"What?"

"I don't know. Something like 'yog hit-tar'?"

"Jag hittar," Chloe breathes. "I'll find."

"You speak Swedish?" Marcus asks.

"No. Yes. Seventeen words of it."

They look at her like she's lost her mind. Maybe she has.

---

## Part 7: Breakdown

"I need to check Cottage Hospital."

"Chloe, you need to rest." Maria's using her mom-voice. "You've been through trauma—"

"You don't understand. He sees—we see—together we—" How to explain? "He painted messages only I could see. For three years. And I answered without knowing. We were having a conversation before we met."

"That doesn't make sense."

"Nothing about us makes sense! I have four color cones. He has partial tetrachromacy. We see UV spectrums. Together we see impossible things."

"Chloe—"

"I know how it sounds. Crazy. Impossible. But it's real. The seventeen warms are real. The paintings are real. He's real."

"Okay." Maria takes her hands. "Okay. Say it's all real. You still need to rest. Eat. Call your parents. Then we'll look."

"But—"

"He's not disappearing. If he's real, if this connection is real, you'll find each other."

"We already lost each other once. For twenty months. I can't—"

"Twenty months? But you just met—"

"That's the problem with time. It's not linear. Not for us."

---

## Part 8: The Wrong Name

Chloe's about to give up when Jennifer from the tower appears.

"Chloe! Thank god. I've been looking for you."

"Jennifer. You made it."

"We all did. Even that Swedish guy you were with."

"You saw him? Where?"

"County Medical. But—"

"He's there? You're sure?"

"Yes, but Chloe—"

She's already moving.

"Wait! They have his name wrong!"

Chloe stops. Turns.

"What?"

"The Swedish guy. They wrote down the wrong name. He kept trying to correct them but his English got all scrambled and they wrote Lars Holberg or Holbrook or something."

Holbrook.

The name hits like ice water.

"Holbrook?"

"Something like that. Why?"

Because Holbrook is the one who accused him. The one whose father owns galleries. The one who forced Hale to become invisible.

"They won't let me see him. If the name's wrong, they won't—"

"So tell them the right name."

"They won't believe me. I'm not family. I'm not even—we're not—"

"You're something. Everyone in that tower could see it."

"See what?"

"The way you two looked at each other. Like you were seeing colors the rest of us couldn't."

If only she knew.

---

## Part 9: The Call to His Mother

Maria's phone. International charges be damned.

"Directory assistance for Uppsala, Sweden. Dr. Karina Lindqvist. Neuroscience department."

Miracle—they have her.

Ringing. Swedish ringback tone, different rhythm.

"Hej, detta är Karina."

"Dr. Lindqvist? This is Chloe Martinez. I was with Hale—"

"Chloe!" The switch to English is instant. "Is he all right? The news says flooding—"

"He's alive. Hospital. But they have his name wrong. They won't let me see him."

"What name do they have?"

"Lars Holbrook or Holberg."

Silence. Then: "Holbrook. Of course. The universe has a cruel sense of humor."

"Can you call? Tell them his real name?"

"I'll do better. I'm flying out. Tonight. But Chloe—"

"Yes?"

"He'll look for you. The moment he can."

"How do you know?"

"Because he's been looking for you for three years. He won't stop now."

"But if they have his name wrong—if I can't find him—"

"You found each other through invisible paintings. You'll find each other through this."

"The paintings. Of course. He'll leave messages."

"Where?"

"Everywhere. Starting with—" She thinks. Where would he go first? "The library. Where we met. Really met."

"Then go there."

"But the hospital—"

"Trust the invisible frequencies, Chloe. They've worked so far."

---

## Part 10: The Decision

"I'm going to the library," Chloe announces.

"The library's flooded," David protests.

"The upper floors aren't."

"Why the library?" Maria asks.

"Because that's where we found each other. That's where he'll leave a message."

"Chloe, this is crazy."

"Everything about us is crazy." She stands, sheds the disaster blanket. "I have tetrachromacy. I see a hundred million colors. He paints in UV. We found each other through invisible art. Crazy is our normal."

"Tetra-what?"

"I'll explain later. After I find him."

"How will you even get there? The roads—"

"I'll walk."

"I'll drive you," Maria says suddenly.

"Maria—"

"If this is real—this connection—then you need to find him. And if it's not real, if it's trauma response, then you need to know that too."

"It's real."

"Then let's go find your UV painter."

They leave the emergency station. Outside, the sun breaks through clouds for the first time in days. It hits at thirty-seven degrees—the angle that makes UV visible to her tetrachromatic eyes.

And there, on the sidewalk, in paint so fresh it's still wet:

*CM + HL*

Their initials. In UV only she can see.

He's already leaving trails.

The conversation continues.

Even separated.

Even with wrong names.

Even in chaos.

They're still finding each other through impossible frequencies.

---

## Part 11: The Parallel Search

**[Meanwhile - County Medical - Same time]**

Hale's fighting his own battle with bureaucracy.

"My name is not Lars Holbrook." Fourth time saying it. Fourth time the admitting nurse looks at him like he's confused.

"Sir, you're suffering from hypothermia. Confusion is normal—"

"I'm not confused. My name. Is Hale. Lindqvist. H-A-L-E."

"That's not what your partner said."

"My what?"

"The woman who came in with you. From the helicopter."

His heart races. "Chloe? Chloe Martinez?"

"No... Jennifer something. She said you were Lars Holbrook from maintenance."

Jennifer. From the tower. Must have tried to help, got everything wrong.

"She misheard. In the chaos. My English—when stressed—" The words scatter. Swedish creeping in. "Snälla, please, my name is Hale."

The nurse sighs. Types something. "I'll make a note. But the system already has you as Holbrook."

"Then change it."

"I need authorization—"

"Then get it."

"Sir, you need to calm down—"

He's already pulling out the IV. "I need to find someone."

"You need medical attention."

"I need Chloe Martinez. Was she here? Red Cross said—"

"I can't share patient information."

The same walls everywhere. Wrong names creating barriers that shouldn't exist.

Security arrives. Big men with kind eyes who don't understand that every minute lost is a minute further from her.

"Sir, you need to stay in bed."

"I need to leave messages. She'll look for me. I need to—" He spots a marker on the bedside table. Grabs it. "Just let me write—"

They're restraining him gently but firmly. The marker drops. Regular ink anyway, not UV. She wouldn't see it even if he could write.

"Sedate him," someone says.

"No, wait—"

The needle goes in. The world softens at the edges.

His last clear thought: She'll find me. She sees impossible things. She'll see through wrong names.

---

## Part 12: Maria's Network

**[Red Cross Station B - 2 PM]**

Maria's building an army without Chloe knowing.

"Listen," she tells Brad, Marcus, Emma, everyone from the tower she can find. "Chloe's looking for someone. Swedish guy. Tall, blonde, paint under his fingernails."

"The UV painter?" Marcus asks. "They were together in the tower?"

"Together is understating it," Emma says. "The way they looked at each other—like they were seeing colors the rest of us couldn't."

"That's literally true," Maria says. "Chloe has tetrachromacy. Sees a hundred million colors. And he paints in UV. They're like—matched frequencies or something."

"That's romantic as fuck," Brad says, surprising everyone. "What? I have feelings."

"Will you help look?"

They all nod. 

"Check every list. Every hospital. Try wrong names—Lars, Holbrook, anything Swedish-sounding. Someone wrote his name wrong and now they're separated."

"On it," Marcus says, pulling out his phone. "I've got a friend at County Medical."

"I know someone at Cottage," Emma adds.

"I'll check the university lists," Brad offers. "Still have my IT login from work-study."

Maria watches them scatter, hunting for a ghost named wrong. Chloe doesn't know it yet, but she's got twenty people looking for her Swedish painter.

Love during disaster creates its own networks.

---

## Part 13: The Mother's Call

**[Red Cross Station B - 3 PM]**

Chloe's on David's phone with her mother, but her mind is elsewhere—tracking UV paint possibilities, calculating where Hale might have gone.

"Mija, you're not listening."

"I am."

"What did I just say?"

"Um—"

"Exactly. Chloe, you've been through trauma—"

"Mom, I need to find him."

"This Swedish boy."

"Hale. His name is Hale."

"You met him during the flood. That creates false bonds—"

"It's not false."

"How can you be sure?"

How to explain that she's been responding to his paintings for three years? That their connection predates their meeting? That she can taste his frequency in the air?

"I just am."

Her mother sighs—that specific Mom-sigh that means love wrapped in worry. "What does he look like?"

"What?"

"Describe him. So I know who I'm looking for."

"You're—you're going to help?"

"I'm your mother. If this boy matters to you, he matters to me. Even if you did meet him during an apocalypse."

"It wasn't an apocalypse."

"Fifteen people trapped in a flooding tower sounds pretty apocalyptic."

"Mom—"

"Describe him."

"Tall. Six-two maybe. Blonde but not California blonde—darker, like wheat in shadow. Green eyes but with gold spots that catch light. Accent that makes English sound like music. Paint under his fingernails always, UV paint that glows blue-white at 365 nanometers. He sees colors almost like I do—not full tetrachromacy but partial, enough that we can—"

"Chloe."

"What?"

"You're in love."

"I—"

"Don't deny it. I can hear it. The way you describe him—like painting with words."

"We just met."

"Time isn't love's only measurement."

This from her practical mother. Her spreadsheet mother. Her 'think with your head not your heart' mother.

"I'll call the Swedish embassy," her mother says. "They keep records of citizens. What's his last name?"

"Lindqvist. L-I-N-D-Q-V-I-S-T."

"Swedish spelling. Of course. I'll call you back."

"Mom—"

"Find him, mija. Whatever this is—trauma bond or true love or something between—find him."

---

## Part 14: The UV Discovery

**[UCSB Campus - 4 PM]**

David drives Chloe back to campus despite orders to go home. The tower still flooded at ground level, but she needs to check.

"This is insane," he says, but he's wading through water beside her.

"There." She points. On the eastern wall, above the water line. UV paint glowing in the afternoon sun.

*HL → CM*
*County Medical Rm 847*
*Look for wrong names*
*I'm painting us visible*

"You see that?" she asks David.

"See what?"

"The message."

"Chloe, there's nothing—"

"UV paint. I can see it. He was here. After the rescue. He came back."

David squints. "If you say so."

"Room 847. County Medical. That's where he is."

"Then let's go."

"You believe me?"

"I believe you believe. And right now, that's enough."

They drive to County Medical. Fast. David running yellow lights while Chloe reads UV messages on every surface—breadcrumbs Hale's been leaving.

*Still here*
*Still looking*
*Still painting seventeen*

All invisible to everyone but her.

---

## Part 15: The Near Miss

**[County Medical - 4:30 PM]**

Room 847. 

Empty.

But not empty of him—she can smell the UV paint, see the messages on the window, feel the seventeen warms still radiating from where he lay.

"Discharged," the nurse says. "About an hour ago."

One hour.

Always one hour, twenty minutes, some measure of time that might as well be infinite.

"Where did he go?"

"I can't—"

"Please." Chloe's voice cracks. "I know you can't share information. But please. I've been looking for twenty months. I found him for eight hours. Lost him again. Please."

The nurse—Patricia—softens. "He mentioned the library. Something about leaving messages where the water began."

The library. Of course.

"Thank you."

"Honey—" Patricia calls after her. "He was looking for you too. Fought three orderlies trying to leave messages. Whatever you two have—it's mutual."

---

## Part 16: The Library Convergence

**[UCSB Library - 5:15 PM]**

The library basement reeks of flood damage. Mold and wet books and something else—UV paint. Fresh. Everywhere.

David waits upstairs while Chloe descends into the damaged stacks. Water-stained shelves. Ruined books. And on every surface, messages in frequencies only she can see:

*497 paintings for you*
*Twenty months of looking*
*Same time same frequency*
*Still here still creating*
*Find me where we began*

And then, on the wall where they first didn't meet three years ago:

*I'm upstairs*
*Right now*
*Northeast corner*
*Physics section*
*QC173.59*
*Our frequency*

Her heart stops. Starts. Races.

He's here. Now. Upstairs.

She runs. Takes stairs three at a time. David calling after her but she can't stop, can't slow, can't risk another twenty minutes of missing.

Physics section. QC173.59—Wave-Particle Duality.

Empty.

No—wait. There. Movement between shelves. Tall figure. Blonde. Reaching up to place a book.

"Hale?"

He turns.

Not him.

Some other tall blonde student. Normal. No paint under fingernails. No seventeen warms. No impossible frequencies.

"Can I help you?" the not-Hale asks.

"I—no. Sorry. I thought—"

"You're looking for the Swedish guy?" 

Her heart stops again. "You know him?"

"He was just here. Like five minutes ago. Left this."

The student hands her a book. *Quantum Entanglement and Observation Effects.*

Inside the cover, UV paint still wet:

*Had to go. They're asking questions.*
*The Holbrook family.*
*Can't let them find you.*
*Tomorrow. Lagoon. Where water began.*
*3:37 PM exactly.*
*When UV becomes visible.*
*Trust the frequencies.*
*- H*

Five minutes.

She missed him by five minutes.

But tomorrow. Tomorrow she won't miss. Tomorrow at 3:37 PM when the light hits at exactly the right angle, she'll find him where the water began.

No more wrong names.
No more near misses.
Just two impossible people making themselves visible in frequencies only they can see.
