# The Tower Filling
*January 9, 2023, 10:30 PM - Storke Tower*

---

## Part 1: The Gathering

They arrive in waves. Water driving them upward.

First: Marcus and Jennifer, who were studying in the 24-hour room when the lights died.

Then: Brad with three others from his business fraternity, all drunk, treating this like adventure instead of disaster.

Emma and her roommate Sarah, both crying, clutching art portfolios like life rafts.

Two engineering students Chloe doesn't know, carrying laptops wrapped in plastic.

A couple she's seen around—always holding hands, now gripping each other like they're already drowning.

A maintenance worker (not Hale, different department) who keeps saying "I told them about the pumps, I told them."

By 10:30, they're fifteen souls in a tower meant for one—the carillonist who plays bells no one listens to.

"We should go higher," Hale says.

He's been watching the water rise through the windows. Calculating. His Swedish precision mixing with American panic.

"This is the highest floor," Marcus points out.

"The roof."

"It's locked."

"I can fix that."

## Part 2: The Social Dynamics

**[10:45 PM - Still in the carillon room]**

Fifteen people create their own weather system. Body heat and fear-sweat and breath fogging windows.

The fraternity boys have claimed a corner, passing a flask that materializes from somewhere. "If we're dying, we're dying drunk."

Jennifer has her pills out, counting. "I have enough Xanax for everyone to take the edge off."

"Save them," Marcus advises. "We might need edges."

Emma's stopped crying. Now she's documenting. Phone out, recording everything. "For after," she says. "So people know."

"No one's going to know," Brad says, harsh. "Look outside."

They do. The campus is gone. Water everywhere, still rising. Emergency lights like drowning stars.

"Someone will find us," the maintenance worker insists. "They have to."

"Who's 'they'?" Brad demands. "Everyone's drowning."

"We're not drowning," Chloe says firmly. "We're surviving."

She doesn't know why she's so certain. Maybe it's the seventeen warms from Hale's proximity. Maybe it's the UV messages that suggest someone meant for them to find each other here. Maybe it's just refusal to accept ending when she just found beginning.

"How do you know?" Jennifer asks.

"Because we have to. Because giving up is boring. Because—" She looks at Hale. "Because some things are too impossible to die."

## Part 3: The UV Discovery

**[11:00 PM]**

One of the fraternity boys—Tyler?—has a blacklight. "For parties," he explains, then demonstrates on his shirt. Greek letters glow.

"Can I?" Hale asks.

Tyler hands it over, probably expecting Hale to check for party residue.

Instead, Hale illuminates the walls.

The room explodes with invisible messages.

Not just Hale's. Others. Years of others. UV graffiti from past and present, all suddenly visible.

*Jenny + Mike 2019*
*Physics is love*
*The bells know everything*
*If you can read this you're special*
*Death is just frequency shift*
*We were here before the water*

That last one makes everyone freeze.

"Before?" Emma reads. "This was written before?"

Hale checks the paint degradation with the light. "Maybe six months old."

"Someone predicted the flood?"

"Or someone's always predicting floods. Santa Barbara's on borrowed time anyway."

But Chloe sees more. With her tetrachromacy, she can parse the layers. The message continues in frequencies the blacklight barely reveals:

*We were here before the water*
*We'll be here after*
*Some things survive everything*
*Even drowning*
*Even time*

"There's more," she says, and reads it aloud.

"How can you see that?" Marcus asks.

So she explains. Again. The four cones. The hundred million colors. The impossible perception.

"That's why you arrange things," Jennifer realizes. "You're organizing by colors we can't see."

"Yes."

"That's not OCD. That's... genius."

"It's exhausting."

"Can you teach us?" Emma asks. "To see more?"

"I don't know. Maybe. Hale sees edges when we touch—"

"When you WHAT?" Brad interrupts.

Hale takes her hand. Demonstrates. "When we touch, I can partially see what she sees. Borders. Edges. Almost."

"That's impossible," one of the engineers says.

"Everything tonight is impossible. Why not this?"

## Part 4: The Confession Circle

**[11:30 PM - Water at the second floor]**

"We should tell truths," Emma suggests. "If we're maybe dying."

"We're not dying," Chloe insists.

"If we're maybe not dying then. Still. Truths."

So they do. Circle formation like kindergarten, but with death lapping at the building.

Tyler: "I cheated on my SATs. Paid someone in China to take them."

Sarah: "I'm pregnant. Found out yesterday. Haven't told anyone."

The quiet engineer: "I build bombs. Not real ones. But I know how. I think about it."

The couple admits they're siblings. Step-siblings. "But still."

The maintenance worker confesses to stealing. "Small things. Tools. Paint."

"Paint?" Hale asks.

"UV paint. Cases of it. From the restoration supply."

"Where?"

"Storage unit. Off Milpas. Probably flooded now."

Hale laughs. Actually laughs. "That's where my paint came from. You stole it and I've been stealing from you."

"You're the ghost painter?"

"Ghost painter?" Chloe asks.

"Campus legend," Marcus explains. "Someone's been painting invisible messages for years. Maintenance thinks it's vandalism but can't prove it because they can't see it."

"I can see it," Chloe says.

"We know that now."

The confessions continue. Each truth makes them more human. Less stranger. More family.

When it's Chloe's turn: "I've been alone my whole life. Even surrounded by people. Because I see things they don't. Until tonight. Until him."

When it's Hale's turn: "I came to America for a girl. She left me for someone visible. I've been invisible ever since. Until tonight. Until her."

## Part 5: The Rising Panic

**[Midnight - Water at the third floor]**

"We need to move." Hale's been calculating. "The roof. Now."

"It's raining."

"It's that or drowning."

They gather what they can. Phones (dead but hopeful). Emma's art (prioritized over food). Jennifer's pills (might need them). The blacklight (for reading messages).

The door to the roof is locked. Of course.

"I can break it," Brad offers.

"I have a better idea." The quiet engineer pulls out a multi-tool. "Give me three minutes."

Takes two.

The door opens to howling wind and horizontal rain.

"This is worse!" Tyler shouts.

"This is survivable," Hale counters.

They climb out. Fifteen people on a roof in a storm with water rising below.

The bells are here. Massive. Bronze. Silent.

"Ring them!" Emma shouts.

"They're electric. No power."

"Then manually!"

They try. Several of them grabbing the largest bell, pulling. It moves slightly. Makes a sound too low to hear but Chloe can see it—subsonic frequencies creating color in rain.

"Again!"

They pull. The bell rings. Deep, mournful, wrong. But loud.

"Keep going! Someone will hear!"

They take turns. Ringing bells for help. For hope. For something to do besides wait to drown.

---

## Part 6: The Midnight Kiss

It happens without planning.

Everyone's focused on the bells, on survival, on the water that's now at the fourth floor.

Chloe and Hale stand apart. Watching the flood consume everything.

"If we don't make it—" she starts.

"We will."

"But if—"

He kisses her.

Not desperate. Not ending. Deliberate. Like he's writing a message only she can read.

The kiss tastes like:
- Swedish snow (how does she know what that tastes like?)
- UV paint (metallic and bright)
- Seventeen different kinds of hope
- The color of his voice at this frequency
- Future

When they part, everyone's staring.

"Did you just—?" Emma asks.

"We just—" Chloe confirms.

"You've known each other four hours."

"Four and a half."

"That's insane."

"Everything about tonight is insane."

"Fair point."

Brad starts laughing. Can't stop. "We're going to die and you two are falling in love. It's like the fucking Titanic."

"Nobody's dying," Hale says firmly. "And this isn't like anything. This is specifically us."

"Specifically impossible," Chloe adds.

They kiss again. The others look away. Give them privacy in the zero privacy of a roof.

The bells ring. The water rises. The kiss continues.

And somehow, impossibly, the water stops just inches from the roof.

"Did you—did the kiss—?" Emma can't finish.

"Coincidence," Marcus says.

"Magic," Jennifer counters.

"Physics we don't understand," Chloe offers.

But she's smiling when she says it.

## Part 7: The Long Hours

**[2:00 AM - Still on the roof]**

They've reorganized. Fifteen people can't stand forever. They sit in a circle, backs to the bells, facing out. Body heat shared. Stories told to stay awake.

Brad admits he's gay. "If we survive, I'm coming out."

Tyler promises to tell the truth about his SATs.

Sarah decides to keep the baby. "If it survived this, it's meant to be."

The engineers exchange numbers, planning to build something beautiful instead of destructive.

The step-siblings decide to tell their parents.

Jennifer shares her pills. Half doses. Just enough to take the edge off dying.

Emma documents everything. Phone dead but she's drawing now, on her own skin with markers someone found.

And Chloe and Hale sit together, her head on his shoulder, counting heartbeats and breaths and the minutes until dawn.

"Tell me about Sweden," she says.

So he does. Stories of snow and light and colors that only exist in Arctic winter. She tells him about Santa Barbara, about growing up seeing too much, about the loneliness of impossible perception.

They're creating their history in real-time. Building a past from nothing because their future depends on it.

"When we get out—" he says.

"When. I like when."

"When we get out, I want to paint you."

"Paint me?"

"In frequencies only we can see. Document what we are."

"Which is?"

"Proof that impossible connections exist."

The others are listening. Not pretending otherwise.

"That's beautiful," Emma says.

"That's survival," Hale corrects. "We survive by creating evidence we existed."

## Part 8: Dawn

**[5:30 AM]**

Light comes slowly. Gray, then pink, then gold.

The water has receded slightly. Still too high, but lower.

In the distance: helicopters.

"THEY'RE COMING!" Brad screams.

Everyone jumps up. Waves. Shouts. The bells ring again—all of them pulling together, making cacophony that means *we're here we're alive we survived.*

The first helicopter circles. Spots them. Radios.

More come.

"We made it," Jennifer breathes. "We actually made it."

But Chloe and Hale know what's coming. Different helicopters. Different destinations. Separation.

"I'll find you," he promises.

"I know."

"Even if it takes—"

"Twenty months?"

"How do you know?"

"I don't. But twenty feels right. Something about the number."

They kiss again. The others pretend not to watch but they all do. It's beautiful—two people finding each other at the end of the world, about to lose each other to bureaucracy and rescue protocols.

The first helicopter hovers. Drops a basket.

"Women first!" the megaphone voice commands.

"Together!" Hale shouts back.

"One at a time! Weight limits!"

This is it. The separation.

"Remember," Chloe tells everyone. "Remember each other's marks. The patterns we made. Find each other after."

They nod. Promise. Mean it.

She climbs in the basket. Rises. Away from Hale, from their impossible night, from the fifteen who became family in flood water.

Below, she sees him painting one last message on the roof. In UV that will only be visible at certain angles, certain times.

She can't read it from here. But knows what it says:

*This is not the end*

Twenty months later, she'll be right.
