# Tuesday Afternoon
*September 24, 2024 - One Week After Reunion*

---

## Part 1: The Lab

Marine Science Building. Second floor. The lab Dr. Tanaka commandeered smells like salt and formaldehyde—wrong combination for new love, perfect for testing if love's real.

Chloe sits on a metal stool, watching Hale mix paints. They've been professional all week. Careful. Like if they touch too much, they'll discover the whole thing dissolves. Seven days since the reunion. Eight since she first saw the UV messages. One hundred sixty-eight hours of careful distance.

"More blue," she says.

He adds blue. Cerulean, but she sees twelve variations within it—sky-blue, water-blue, drowning-blue, surviving-blue. His hand shakes—just barely. She sees it in frequencies others wouldn't. The shake has color: purple-doubt with gold edges of want.

"Still wrong," she says about the paint. Not about the paint.

"What you want it to be?"

"Real."

He sets down the palette. "The paint?"

"Everything."

They've been dancing around this all week. Meeting for the research project. Documenting their parallel creation. Professional. Careful. Not kissing. Barely touching. Testing if what felt like love in death-shadow feels like love in fluorescent light.

"Are we going to talk about it?" she asks.

"Which it?"

"The fear."

"Which fear?"

"That we're not real. That we're just trauma bonding. That in normal light, normal life, we're normal strangers who happen to see impossible colors."

He looks at her. She counts forty-three different greens in his eyes, but behind them all—terror. The specific terror of discovering that the most real thing in your life might be trauma-made fiction.

---

## Part 2: The Therapy Voices

"My therapist," he starts. Stops. Restarts. "Dr. Johansson. She says trauma bonds—"

"Fade. I know. Mine says the same."

"Has been seven days since reunion."

"Eight."

"You're counting."

"I count everything. You know this."

He does know. Knows she's been counting:
- Eight days since reunion
- Seventeen touches (all brief, all careful, all catalogued)
- Ninety-three shared glances
- Four hundred twelve minutes in the same room
- Zero kisses since the coffee shop
- Zero mentions of the tower night
- Zero admissions that they're terrified

"What else does your therapist say?" she asks.

"That I'm projecting. That you represent survival. That my brain conflates you with not-drowning. That I painted your frequencies for three years because disaster makes us see patterns that aren't there."

"Mine says I'm creating patterns where none exist. That you're a blank canvas I'm painting with meaning. That I arranged things in response to your paintings because trauma survivors seek control through false connections."

"Maybe they're right."

"Maybe."

They sit with that. The lab equipment hums at frequency that tastes metallic. Outside, students pass, normal lives in normal light. Inside, two people who see impossible things try to figure out if they're impossibly connected or just impossibly damaged.

"But," Chloe says.

"But?"

"Your paintings from before the flood. October, November, December. You were already painting in my frequencies. Before the trauma. Before we met. Before we had reason to create false patterns."

"Could be coincidence. Or unconscious pattern recognition. Maybe all tetrachromats gravitate toward similar frequencies."

"Four hundred ninety-seven coincidences? In exactly the order I was arranging things? With timing that matches my Instagram posts to the hour?"

"Could be."

"Do you believe that?"

"I want to."

"Why?"

"Because—" He switches to Swedish, then back. "Because if is coincidence, then losing you won't matter. If is trauma bond, will fade. But if is real—"

"If it's real, losing it would be losing everything."

"Yes."

---

## Part 3: The Test Proposal

She stands. Walks to the window. Counts seventeen different refractions in the glass—light bending into frequencies that shouldn't exist. Just like them.

"We need to test it," she says.

"How?"

"Scientifically. Controlled conditions. Eliminate variables."

"You sound like Dr. Tanaka now."

"I have a physics degree. Before art. Did I tell you that?"

"No. We don't talk about before. Only about flood, after."

He's right. They talk about the flood, the searching, the reunion. Never before. Like they started existing that night in the tower.

"I was going to be a color scientist," she says. "Study how humans perceive light. Then I realized I perceive it differently than everyone else and science couldn't explain me."

"So you became artist?"

"So I became someone who arranges things obsessively and photographs blank walls."

"Artist."

"If you say so."

She turns from the window. "We have two hours before Tanaka returns. Two hours to test if we're real."

"How?"

She pulls out a canvas from behind the lab bench. To most eyes: blank. To hers: his first painting of her, from October before the flood. Before they'd ever spoken. UV paint invisible except to those who can see.

"You painted this before you knew I existed."

"Yes."

"It's precious to you."

"Yes."

"Irreplaceable."

"Where you going with this?"

"Paint over it. Change it. Make it new."

"Why?"

"Because if this is just trauma bond, you won't be able to. The flood-night paintings would be sacred. Frozen. Untouchable."

"And if it's real?"

"If it's real, if we're alive and growing, you'll change it. Because living things change. Dead things stay frozen."

---

## Part 4: The Transformation

He stares at the canvas for thirty-seven seconds. She counts. Always counting. Then he picks up his brush.

"You're sure?"

"No. That's why it's a test."

He dips the brush in paint—new UV formula they've been developing. Brighter. More complex. Visible in more light conditions. Evolution of his technique.

"This painting," he says, brush hovering. "I painted it October third. 2:17 AM. Couldn't sleep. Kept seeing patterns in my head."

"What patterns?"

"Don't know. Just... frequencies. Like someone was broadcasting and I was receiving."

"October third. I was in the library. Same time. Arranging books."

"You remember?"

"I remember every arrangement. October third was spirals. Seventeen books in spiral pattern. The librarian yelled at me."

He touches brush to canvas. Not around the old work—through it. Over it. Transforming October's unconscious longing into September's conscious choice.

She watches the forty-three greens in his eyes shift—doubt-green becoming certainty-green becoming something she hasn't seen before. Creation-green. Future-green. The green of choosing to change.

"You're really doing it."

"We're changing. Art should change too."

The painting evolves under his hands. What was searching becomes finding. What was question becomes answer. But more—it becomes question again, new questions, future questions they haven't thought to ask.

"Can I?" She gestures at the brush.

"You want to paint?"

"I want to try."

He hands her the brush. First time. She's arranged, photographed, documented—never painted. The brush feels wrong in her hand. Too deliberate. Not like arranging, which happens without thought.

"Just feel," he says. "Don't think."

"I always think."

"Not now. Now you feel."

She touches brush to canvas. Adds her own layer. The paint flows different from her hand—not better or worse, just different. Her colors visible only in certain lights, from certain angles. Together they're creating something neither could make alone. Could never have made in the tower. Could only make now, after twenty months of searching taught them the shape of absence.

---

## Part 5: The Synchronization

They paint without talking. Don't need to. Their hands move in rhythm—not same movements but complementary. When he goes left, she goes right. When he adds warm, she adds cool. Building something balanced.

"You're humming," he says.

"Am I?"

"Some song. Don't recognize."

She listens to herself. Is humming. The tune familiar but unplaceable.

"You're humming too," she realizes.

"Different song."

"No. Same song. Different octave."

They stop. Listen. They're humming harmonies to something neither consciously knows.

"That's impossible," he says.

"Everything about us—"

"Is impossible. I know. But this is new impossible."

"Good impossible?"

"Strange impossible."

They go back to painting. Back to humming. The painting grows layer by layer. October becoming September becoming something beyond time.

The door opens.

---

## Part 6: The Witness

Dr. Tanaka enters, carrying coffee and data tablets. Stops. Sees them painting together. Sees their hands not touching but moving in synchronization. Sees something she can't quite name.

"Oh," she says. "You're—"

She stops. No word for what they're doing. In regular light: two people painting. In UV light (she has spectrometer): conversation in color. In frequencies only Chloe can fully see: love making itself visible one brushstroke at a time.

"We're testing," Chloe says.

"Testing what?"

"If we're real."

"Real as opposed to?"

"Trauma bond. Projection. Shared delusion. Pick your psychological term."

Dr. Tanaka sets down her coffee. Approaches the canvas. Even with her limited vision, she can see something. The paint isn't just paint. It's language. Private language for impossible connection.

"May I?" She pulls out her spectrometer. Scans the canvas. The readout shows wavelengths that shouldn't exist together. Frequencies that should cancel each other out but instead create harmony.

"This is scientifically impossible," she says.

"But it exists," Hale says.

"Yes. It exists. Impossible but real." She looks at them. "Like you two."

"Is that your professional opinion?" Chloe asks.

"My professional opinion is that I'm witnessing something outside my understanding. But from here—" She gestures at them, the canvas, the synchronized breathing she's just noticing. "From here, looks real to me."

She takes her coffee and data to the far bench. "I'll be working over here. Pretend I'm not here."

But they can't pretend. Her witness changes things. Makes it real in new way. External validation of internal truth.

---

## Part 7: The Admission

After Tanaka settles into her work, they return to painting. But something's shifted. The careful distance they've maintained all week feels artificial now.

"Hale."

"Mm?"

"I'm scared."

He sets down his brush. "Of?"

"This. Us. The way we're already synchronizing. The humming. The painting. It's like we're becoming one organism."

"Is that bad?"

"It's terrifying."

"Why?"

"Because what happens if we lose each other again? If we're this connected and then separated—"

"We survived twenty months."

"Barely. And we didn't know what we were missing. Now we do."

He moves closer. Not touching. Just reducing distance. She can feel his seventeen warms from here—different than the tower. Not desperate heat. Sustainable heat. Daily heat. The kind that lasts.

"So what you want?" he asks.

"I want to be brave enough to find out what we are."

"And?"

"I want to stop being careful. Stop testing. Start living."

"What would that look like?"

She turns to face him fully. "It would look like kissing you in this ugly lab with fluorescent lights and formaldehyde smell. It would look like choosing you in non-emergency. It would look like making art together even when we're not drowning."

"The tower kiss tasted like ending," she continues. "What would this one taste like?"

"Only one way to find out."

---

## Part 8: The Non-Emergency Kiss

He kisses her.

Not like the tower—no death circling, no water rising, no emergency lights. Just them in a lab that smells wrong for love but right for truth.

The kiss tastes like beginning-without-ending. Like sustainable frequency. Like daily choice. Like Tuesday afternoon and all the Tuesday afternoons to come.

Her perception explodes but differently than before. Not the overwhelming synesthesia of crisis but something steadier. She sees their frequencies interweaving—his forty-three greens with her seventeen warms creating new colors. Sustainable colors. Living colors.

When they part, she laughs. The sound has color—gold-relief with silver edges of recognition.

"What?" he asks.

"We're real. Trauma bonds don't taste like Tuesday afternoon. Don't smell like formaldehyde and hope. Don't feel like choosing instead of drowning."

"So we're—?"

"We're something that survived the flood but isn't the flood. We're what happens after after."

"After after?"

"After the trauma. After the searching. After the reunion. We're the daily choice part."

He kisses her again. This one tastes like paint and salt and the specific frequency of love that's been tested and proven and ready to make impossible things.

"Want to know something?" he says.

"What?"

"Painted you again last night. Even though you're here. Even though found you. Still needed to paint you."

"I arranged my entire spice rack at 3 AM."

"Why?"

"Because that's what we do. Not from trauma. From truth. We're people who create in response to each other. Always have. Even before we knew the other existed."

"Is that sustainable?"

"Is breathing sustainable? It's just what we do."

---

## Part 9: The New Pattern

They go back to painting. Together but also separately. Adding layers only they can see. Creating future in frequencies that shouldn't exist.

"Hey," she says, watching him paint impossible blues.

"What?"

"We're going to make so much art together."

"Good art?"

"Invisible art. Impossible art. Art only we can see until we teach others to see it too."

"That's what you want? To teach others?"

"I want people with abilities like ours to know they're not alone. That invisible doesn't mean isolated."

"Like we were."

"Like we were. But aren't anymore."

He adds another stroke. She mirrors it in different color. The painting becoming conversation becoming proof that connection transcends crisis.

"I love you," he says. Matter-of-fact. Like stating wavelength measurement.

"I know."

"How?"

"I can see it. Literally. You're radiating at frequency 528 Hz. The love frequency. It has color—gold-green with purple edges."

"You can see love?"

"I can see your love. It has specific frequency. Probably different for everyone."

"What frequency is your love?"

"Look for yourself."

He looks. Can't see what she sees but can see something. Edges. Borders. Places where impossible becomes visible.

"It's like... silver? But warm?"

"432.5 Hz. The frequency of trust."

"Love and trust are different frequencies?"

"For us. Makes sense, doesn't it? We fell in love in the tower. But trust—trust took twenty months of searching. Trust takes Tuesday afternoons."

---

## Part 10: The Future Visible

Dr. Tanaka leaves eventually, muttering about impossible wavelength combinations and preparing grant proposals. They barely notice. Too absorbed in creating.

The canvas now holds hours of work. Layers of conversation. October's original painting transformed but not erased—foundation for something larger.

"It's beautiful," Chloe says.

"You can see all of it?"

"Every layer. Every frequency. Past and present occupying same space without canceling."

"Metaphor?"

"Reality."

She takes photos with her phone. Through the screen: interesting abstract art. Through her eyes: their entire story from unconscious beginning to conscious choice.

"What now?" Hale asks.

"Now we stop testing and start creating."

"Together?"

"No other way."

"Even though it's terrifying?"

"Especially then."

## Part 11: The Email Investigation
*[September 25, 2024 - The Next Day]*

Chloe sits in her apartment, laptop open, staring at the customs form photo she took yesterday. The shipping label from Chapter 13's vinyl discovery keeps pulling at her—something about the precise handwriting, the professional packing, the apology note.

**NordWax Archivist - D. Marchand, Oulu, Finland**

She types an email, deletes it, types again. How do you explain you're investigating someone's boyfriend based on a shipping error from three years ago?

*Subject: Inquiry about shipping error - Botanical Lathe record*

*Dear D. Marchand,*

*My friend received a record from your shop that appears to have been shipped in error. The customs form indicates it was meant for H.E. Lindqvist at Lund University, but was delivered to Hale Eriksson in Santa Barbara. The record is "Botanical Lathe - Ecosystem" #003/5.*

*We're trying to understand the shipping history as there have been some complications. Would you have any documentation about this transaction?*

*Best regards,*  
*Chloe Martinez*

She hesitates over the send button. This feels like crossing a line—investigating Hale's past without telling him. But the timing bothers her. The record arrived right when accusations started flying. Right when his art program collapsed. Right when he became invisible.

She hits send.

The reply comes within two hours. 

*Dear Ms. Martinez,*

*Thank you for your inquiry. I maintain detailed shipping records for insurance purposes. Item #003/5 "Botanical Lathe - Ecosystem" was indeed mis-picked from inventory on March 15, 2021.*

*The error occurred during our spring reorganization. The intended recipient was H.E. Lindqvist (PhD candidate, Nordic Studies, Lund University). However, our barcode system selected a similar customer entry: H. Eriksson, Santa Barbara address on file from a previous inquiry about Kylmärauha pressings.*

*I have the complete shipping documentation if this would be helpful for your investigation. The record contains UV-reactive sleeve art from an Oulu anti-fascist collective - quite valuable from a historical perspective.*

*I apologize for any confusion this error may have caused.*

*Best regards,*  
*Dominic Marchand*  
*NordWax Archivist*

*P.S. - The UV layer shows "EI VÄKIVALLALLE" (No to violence) with date stamps from a 2019 pop-up event. Thought you should know the actual content.*

Chloe stares at the screen. **UV-reactive sleeve art**. **Anti-fascist collective**. The timing clicks into place—Hale received evidence of anti-extremist activism right when he was being accused of extremist connections.

She forwards the email to her own archive, then calls Hale.

"Hey," his voice warm through the phone. "How's your seventeen warms today?"

"Complicated. Can I come over? I found something about that record Tommy brought."

"The Finnish one? Of course. You sound—what's wrong?"

"Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. I'll be there in twenty minutes."

---

## Part 12: The Evidence Unfolds

Hale's apartment smells like paint and coffee—sustainable scents for sustainable love. He opens the door before she knocks, reading the frequency of her worry from three floors down.

"Show me," he says immediately.

She pulls out her laptop, opens Dommo's email. Watches Hale's face change as he reads—confusion becoming recognition becoming something that tastes like vindication mixed with old grief.

"UV sleeve art," he says quietly. "Anti-fascist collective."

"The timing, Hale. You got this record right when the accusations started. Evidence of actual anti-extremist work, shipped to you by accident."

"While Derek was telling everyone I was the extremist."

"While someone needed to paint you as dangerous to protect the real problem."

He sits heavily on his couch—the same couch where he paints at 3 AM, where she first saw him create impossible frequencies in regular light.

"There's more," she says, scrolling to Dommo's postscript. "The UV layer. 'No to violence' with date stamps. This wasn't just music, it was documentation. Proof of participation in actual anti-fascist activism."

"In Finland. While I was being accused of extremist connections here."

"While Derek needed you to disappear."

Hale looks at his hands—the hands that paint messages only she can see, that were accused of violence they'd never commit.

"Should we contact this Dominic person? Ask for the documentation he mentioned?"

"I already did."

She shows him the response that came while she was driving over:

*Ms. Martinez,*

*I've attached digital scans of the shipping documentation:*
*- Original barcode scan showing the error*  
*- Packing slip with my handwritten notation*
*- Photos of the UV sleeve art taken under blacklight*
*- Insurance valuation (quite substantial)*

*The record was meant for academic research into Nordic anti-fascist culture. The UV layer is historically significant - documentation of grassroots resistance movements.*

*If your friend is facing difficulties related to this shipping error, I'm willing to provide testimony. I keep meticulous records specifically to prevent these kinds of problems.*

*Regards,*  
*D. Marchand*

The attachments load. Hale watches documentation unfold—timestamp photos, shipping labels, the UV art blazing under blacklight. His name nowhere on the original order. Clear evidence of a shipping mistake that delivered anti-extremist documentation to someone being accused of extremist sympathies.

"The irony," he says, voice hollow. "Perfect evidence I'm not what they said, delivered by accident to prove it."

"Not accident. The universe correcting itself."

"You believe in universe correction?"

"I believe in meticulous record-keeping by Finnish vinyl archivists who care about truth."

He laughs—the sound has color, silver-relief with gold edges of hope.

"What do we do with this?"

"We keep it. For when we need it."

"You think we'll need it?"

"Tommy mentioned Holbrook asking questions about Swedish UV artists. Your work is getting attention. If someone tries to revive old accusations..."

"We have Dominic's documentation."

"We have proof."

He pulls her close. She counts seventeen different temperatures where their bodies touch—not desperate heat like the tower, but steady warmth like choosing each other in regular light.

"Thank you," he says. "For investigating. For caring enough to find truth."

"Thank you for being worth investigating for."

They clean brushes. Pack supplies. Normal actions after extraordinary afternoon. The painting needs to dry. They need to eat. Life needs to continue beyond this lab.

"Dinner?" he asks.

"Somewhere with terrible lighting."

"Why?"

"To prove we're real in ugly light too."

"I know place. Fluorescent disaster. Plastic chairs. Terrible acoustic."

"Perfect."

They leave the lab. The painting remains, drying in seventeen different spectrums. Proof that love tested is different from love assumed. That Tuesday afternoon connections last longer than emergency kisses. That two people who see impossible colors can create impossible future.

Real doesn't mean easy.
Real doesn't mean not scared.
Real means choosing to change the painting.
Real means kissing with fluorescent lights.
Real means creating especially when you're not drowning.
Real means investigating shipping errors to protect someone you love.
Real means meticulous Finnish archivists who document truth.
Real means evidence arriving by accident at exactly the right time.

The sun sets at thirty-seven degrees. For four minutes, every UV message Hale has painted on campus becomes visible. But they don't need those messages anymore.

They have each other.
They have Tuesday afternoons.
They have all the impossible art they're going to make.
They have Dominic Marchand's documentation.
They have proof.

That's real.
That's enough.
That's everything.

## Part 13: The Gallery Preparation

**[Three Days Later - Marcus's Gallery]**

Marcus is nervous. Chloe can see it in forty-three different colors radiating from his temples.

"They're coming," he says. "The Holbrooks. Both of them."

"Let them come," Hale says. Calm. Ready.

"You don't understand. They've destroyed careers. They've—"

"They've never faced someone with evidence," Chloe interrupts. "Finnish archivists don't lie."

The gallery transformed for tomorrow's opening. Their work everywhere—UV and visible, impossible and documented. The centerpiece: their portrait from the studio night, both of them covered in each other's frequencies.

"It's pornographic," Marcus worried initially.

"It's science," Dr. Tanaka corrected. "The first documented visual proof of tetrachromatic perception."

Now it hangs central. Unavoidable. Undeniable.

Tommy arrives with more vinyl. "Thought you'd want the full collection for tomorrow. Every record that survived the flood."

He's brought seventeen crates. Of course seventeen.

"Why?" Hale asks.

"Because your story isn't just about art. It's about everything the flood couldn't destroy. Including you two."

---

## Part 14: The Night Before

**[Hale's apartment - 2 AM]**

Can't sleep. Both of them awake, mapping eighteen warms in the darkness.

"What if they win?" Chloe asks.

"They won't."

"But if they do? If they convince everyone you're—"

"Then we leave. Start over. Create somewhere else."

"You'd give up everything?"

"Everything except you."

She turns to face him. Even in darkness, she can see his heat signature perfectly. The geography of him mapped in temperature.

"That's romantic."

"That's practical. I can paint anywhere. But I can only see properly with you."

"You mean the partial tetrachromacy?"

"I mean everything. I was invisible for three years. You made me real."

"You were always real."

"Not like this. Not real enough to fight back. Tomorrow, we stop hiding."

"Tomorrow, we become visible."

"We already are. Tomorrow, we make everyone else see it."
