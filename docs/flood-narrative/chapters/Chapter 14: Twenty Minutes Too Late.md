# Twenty Minutes Too Late
*January 2023 - August 2024: Twenty Months of Looking*

## Month One: The Wrong Records

**[January 15, 2023 - County Medical Records Department]**

The fluorescent lights hurt. Everything hurts since the flood—light too bright, sounds too sharp, colors screaming frequencies only Chloe can hear.

"I need to find someone," she tells the records clerk for the third time today. Fourth time this week. "From the flood. January ninth."

"Name?"

"Hale Lindqvist. Or Lars Holbrook. Or—the records are wrong. They're all wrong."

The clerk—DEBORAH, her name tag says—looks tired. Everyone looks tired since the flood. "Miss Martinez, we've been through this. No one by those names was admitted."

"But there was a Swedish male, transferred from Red Cross Station A—"

"Seventeen Swedish males were treated. None with those names."

Seventeen. Of course. Their number everywhere.

"Can I see the list?"

"That's confidential."

"Please. He has green eyes. Paint under his fingernails. A scar on his left thumb—"

How does she know about the scar? She saw it for five seconds in emergency light. But her tetrachromatic memory stores everything in impossible detail.

"I'm sorry."

Chloe leaves. Comes back the next day. And the next.

By the end of the month, Deborah knows her coffee order (black, seventeen sugars—a joke no one gets) and her story (flood survivor looking for someone who might not exist).

"There was one thing," Deborah says on January 31st. "A patient. No insurance, paid cash. Left AMA."

"Against medical advice?"

"January 12th. Three days after the flood. But the name—"

"What name?"

"H. Eriksson. Different spelling. Swedish, though."

Eriksson. Not Lindqvist. But H.

Hale.

"Where did he go?"

"No forwarding address. But—" Deborah shouldn't be doing this. "He left something. In the room. Cleaning found it."

She pulls out a ziplock bag. Inside: a paint-stained cloth. Regular people see random colors. Chloe sees: UV paint in specific pattern. Seventeen strokes. A message.

She touches the bag. The paint is his. She knows it like she knows her own heartbeat—the specific frequency of his creation.

"Thank you," she whispers.

"Find him," Deborah says. "Whatever this is, find him."

---

## Month Two: The Hospital Calls

Chloe develops a routine. Every morning, 7 AM, before the world gets too loud:

"I'm looking for Hale Lindqvist. H-A-L-E. Swedish. From the flood."

"No record."

She tries variations:
- Lars Holstrom (what they wrote)
- Swedish male, no ID  
- Storke Tower survivor
- UV painter (they think she's crazy)

One morning, a different answer:

"We had a Lars. Discharged January 12th."

Her heart stops. "Where did he go?"

"No forwarding address."

Of course not. He was invisible before the flood. More invisible after.

---

## Month Three: The Library Returns

**[March 2023 - UCSB Library, 2 AM]**

She shouldn't be here. The library's still under repair, officially closed. But the night janitor, Eddie, lost his daughter in the flood. He understands searching for ghosts.

"Twenty minutes," he says, unlocking the door. "That's all I can give you."

Twenty minutes. Always twenty minutes.

The basement where they first properly met still smells like water damage. Books gone, shelves empty. But the walls—

In UV light from her phone (she bought a blacklight flashlight, though she doesn't need it), messages everywhere:

*Still here - H*
*January 27*

*Looking - H*  
*February 3*

*Remember seventeen - H*
*February 19*

A month of messages. He's been coming back. Writing to her. She just missed them.

She pulls out a UV marker (bought a pack, keeps them always). Writes on the only clear spot:

*I see you - C*
*March 15*

Comes back the next night. Her message is circled. Underneath:

*Saw this March 16*
*You were here yesterday*  
*I'm here today*
*Time is broken - H*

Always missing by hours. By minutes. By the space between heartbeats.

---

## Month Four: The Instagram Trail

[ONE privileged perception - unconscious patterns]

She posts her arrangements. Doesn't know why. Compulsion. Need. Faith maybe.

One photo gets a comment: @NorthernLights237: "Beautiful frequency."

The profile: empty. Created yesterday. But "frequency"—who uses that word?

She messages: "Hale?"

Account deleted by morning.

But she knows. Somewhere, he's seeing her patterns. Responding in only way he can—invisible, careful, present but not.

---

## Month Seven: Tommy's Bar

[Free indirect - hope bleeding into narration]

Tommy's bar on State Street. She goes because Maria insists she needs to get out. Sees the vinyl collection behind bar. Black metal. Swedish pressings.

"Where did these come from?"

"Storage unit auction. Some guy lost everything in the flood."

Some guy. Swedish guy. Her guy.

"Can I buy them?"

"They're not for sale. But—" Tommy studies her. "You're the one, aren't you? Marcus told me. Girl who sees impossible colors."

"How do you—?"

"The Swedish guy. Hale. He asked about you. Month ago. Described you perfect. Color girl who arranges things."

Month ago. He was here. Looking for her while she was looking for him.

"Where is he?"

"Don't know. Paid cash. Left. But said if girl who sees colors comes, tell her—" Tommy thinks. "Tell her 'seventeen.'"

Seventeen.

The message finds her seven months late. But it finds her.

---

## Month Ten: The Near Miss at UCSB

She returns to campus. Needs to see where it happened. Where they happened.

The tower's rebuilt. No trace of flood. But in the carillon room, in UV only she can see:

*Still looking - H*
*January 2024*

Fresh. Recent. Days maybe.

She camps out. Waits. Returns every day for a week.

He doesn't come back.

Later learns from maintenance: "Tall Swedish guy was here. Did some painting. Said he was documenting something. Haven't seen him since."

Always just missing. Always days or hours or minutes too late.

---

## Month Twelve: The Airport Disaster

**[January 9, 2024 - Anniversary - Seattle-Tacoma International]**

She's here for a color perception conference. Coincidence that it's the flood anniversary. Coincidence that she's thinking about him every second.

The art supply store calls to her—airport prices be damned. She needs UV markers. Needs to leave messages. Even here. Especially here.

The cashier—pierced, painted nails in seventeen different colors (she counts)—looks up from organizing inventory.

"Weird question," the cashier says. "You're the second person today asking about tetrachromatic-responsive paint."

The world stops.

Chloe's hand freezes reaching for her wallet. "Second person?"

"Yeah. Swedish guy. Tall. Green eyes. Bought like two hundred dollars worth of UV markers. Said something about needing to leave messages."

"When?"

"Maybe..." The cashier checks the register. "Twenty-two minutes ago."

Twenty minutes. Always twenty fucking minutes.

"Which way did he go?"

"Toward C gates. Mentioned Stockholm."

Chloe runs.

C gates. Forty-seven gates. She starts at C1.

"Excuse me, Stockholm flight?"

"C23. But boarding's closed."

She runs. Lungs burning. Seventeen gates to go.

C23. The board says STOCKHOLM - DEPARTED.

"When?" she gasps at the gate agent.

"Three minutes ago. You can see it—" The agent points out the window. Plane backing from gate.

Three minutes.

"Was there—passenger list—Hale Lindqvist?"

"I can't share passenger information."

"Please. Emergency. Life or death."

Not a lie. Feels like death, this constant missing.

The agent softens. Types quickly. "No one by that name."

"Lars? H. Eriksson? Anything Swedish-sounding?"

"I'm sorry."

Chloe sits at the gate. Watches the plane taxi. Takes off. Disappears.

Later, she'll learn he wasn't on that flight. Was actually at D36, waiting for Vancouver. Different direction entirely. The cashier misheard or misunderstood or just guessed wrong.

Twenty minutes and wrong information.

Their timing broken by more than time.

---

## Month Thirteen: The Color Conference

[ONE double-encoded scene]

Berkeley. Dr. Martinez's tetrachromacy symposium.

"We have a remarkable case," he tells the audience. "Subject can identify over 300 distinct shades in what appears white to typical vision."

That's her. Subject X. Anonymous because she can't risk exposure.

During break, someone approaches. Tall. Accented. Her heart—

But wrong accent. German, not Swedish.

"Your work on UV perception. There's an artist in Santa Barbara doing similar. Painting in frequencies. You should connect."

Santa Barbara. UV artist.

"What's his name?"

"Don't know. Very private. But his work—it's like he's painting for someone who doesn't exist yet."

Painting for someone who doesn't exist yet.

Painting for her.

---

## Month Fifteen: The Phone Pattern

**[March 2024 - Chloe's Apartment]**

She's stopped actively searching. That's what she tells Dr. Chen. That's what she tells Maria. That's what she tells herself.

But at 2:15 AM—the exact time of their kiss—her phone rings.

No one there.

This has happened seventeen times. Always 2:15. Always silence.

She knows it's him. Has to be. Who else would call at that exact time?

"Hello?" she says to the silence. "Hale?"

Breathing. Maybe. Or wind. Or wishful thinking.

"I'm still here," she says to maybe-nothing. "Still seeing the colors. Still arranging things. Still counting seventeen."

The line stays open for exactly three minutes. The length of their kiss. Then disconnects.

She tries calling back. Number blocked.

But the next night, 2:15 AM, it rings again.

This time she's ready.

"Seventeen warms," she says immediately. "That's what I call your heat signature. Seventeen different temperatures where we touched."

Silence. But different silence. Listening silence.

"I know it's you. Even if you can't talk. Even if it's not safe. I know."

The line stays open five minutes this time.

Progress.

The next night: "I see your paintings. Everywhere. The bathroom at Whole Foods. The underpass on Milpas. The bench at the lagoon. I photograph them all."

Seven minutes.

The next: "I painted something. With UV. My first time. It's terrible. But it's at the library. Where we met. If you want to see."

The breathing definitely changes. Faster. Like running.

Then the line goes dead.

No more calls after that.

But three days later, at the library, next to her terrible UV painting:

*Beautiful. Keep painting. - H*

---

## Month Sixteen: Maria's Revelation

[Status flip - Maria knows more than she's said]

"I've been seeing him."

Chloe's arranging pencils. Drops them all.

"What?"

"Not like that. Just—sometimes. On campus. Night shift. Started again couple months ago."

"Why didn't you—?"

"Because you both asked me not to. Separately. Both said if the other asks, don't tell. Both protecting each other from something that might not be real."

Both protecting. Both stupid.

"Is he—how is he?"

"Thin. Tired. Paints constantly. Asked about you once. I said you were gone. He said good, safer for her."

Safer for her. Still protecting her from false accusation shadow. Still choosing invisibility to keep her safe.

---

## Month Seventeen: The False Lead

**[May 2024 - San Francisco]**

The email arrives at 2:15 AM. Of course it does. Everything important happens at 2:15 now.

*Subject: Swedish UV artist in Mission District*

*Chloe - You don't know me but I know your story through Instagram. There's a Swedish artist here doing UV installations. Tall, blonde, paints at night. Thought you should know. - Anonymous*

She's on a train by 6 AM. Doesn't tell Maria. Doesn't tell anyone. Can't handle their hope or their pity if it's wrong.

San Francisco fog makes everything look like watercolor—buildings bleeding into sky, edges uncertain. Like her tetrachromatic vision but for everyone.

The Mission District gallery is small. "Invisible Frequencies" the exhibition is called.

Her heart stops.

Goes.

The curator, pierced and patient, leads her to the back room. "He only works at night. But his pieces—"

UV paintings everywhere. But wrong. All wrong. The frequency is 385 nanometers, not Hale's 365. The style mechanical, planned. Not the organic explosion of someone painting feelings they can't name.

"What's his name?"

"Björn Andersson."

Not Hale. Of course not Hale.

But then—

"Though he mentioned once his real name was something else. Said he changed it after some incident in Santa Barbara."

The world tilts.

"When can I meet him?"

"Tonight. Midnight. He'll be installing."

She waits. Wanders the city. Counts bridge cables (seventeen sections, always seventeen). Buys UV markers, leaves messages on walls only she'll ever see:

*Still looking - CM*

Midnight comes.

Björn arrives.

He's sixty years old with a beard down to his chest.

Not Hale. Never was Hale.

"You're the color girl," he says in Swedish accent thick as paint. "The one looking for the boy."

"You know about me?"

"Everyone in UV art knows. You two are legend. The flood lovers who painted invisible messages."

"We're not legend. We're real."

"Real becomes legend when no one can prove it."

She shows him photos on her phone. UV messages she's documented.

"Ah," he says. "365 nanometers. Very specific. Your boy has good taste."

"Have you seen work like this? Anywhere?"

"Once. Gallery in Seattle. But the artist never showed. Just sent paintings."

"When?"

"Six months ago? Maybe seven?"

Another lead. Another thread. Another city to search.

"Can I ask you something?" Björn says.

"What?"

"Why keep looking? Twenty months is long time. He might be—"

"He's not."

"How you know?"

How does she know? Because the seventeen warms haven't faded. Because she still tastes copper-salt-snow when she dreams. Because—

"Because I'm still answering his paintings. If he were gone, I'd stop."

"You still create? Even without him?"

"The creation is how I find him."

Björn nods. "Then you will find. Creation always finds its match."

She takes the train home. Another false lead. Another not-Hale. But also another person who believes in invisible frequencies.

The network of impossible believers grows.

## Month Eighteen: The Storage Unit

The storage unit that held Hale's vinyl. Cleaned out, but on the wall, in UV:

*497 paintings for C*
*If you find this, I existed*
*I remember seventeen*

497 paintings. She's been counting her arrangements. Also 497.

Perfect parallel. Perfect unconscious synchronization.

They've been having the same conversation in different languages for eighteen months.

---

## Month Eighteen: The Gallery Opening

**[June 2024 - Downtown Santa Barbara]**

"You have to come," Maria insists. "It's Marcus from the flood. His first show."

Chloe doesn't want to go. Galleries mean people. People mean questions. Questions mean explaining why she's still arranging everything, still seeing impossible colors, still looking for someone who might be imaginary.

But Maria drives her. Literally forces her into the car.

The gallery is small. Crowded. Marcus's paintings are waves and drowning and survival. Everyone from the flood seems to be here. Jennifer. Brad. Even Emma flew in from Portland.

"Chloe!" Marcus hugs her. "You made it!"

"Your work is—" She stops. In the corner. A painting she didn't expect.

It's the tower. Their tower. But painted in regular light and—underneath, visible only to her—UV layer. Someone else painted the UV. Someone who was there.

"Marcus. This painting. Who—?"

"Oh, that's a collaboration. This Swedish guy. He was in the tower with us, remember? Tall, quiet? He did the underpainting. I did the visible layer."

"He was here? When?"

"Last week. Dropped off the canvas. Said he couldn't stay for the opening but wanted to contribute."

Last week.

"Did he leave contact information?"

"No. Just...wait, he did say something weird. Said if the woman who counts everything comes, tell her he remembers."

He remembers.

"Marcus, I need the canvas. The underpainting. I need to see—"

"It's UV. You'd need a blacklight."

She doesn't. She can see it perfectly. A message, painted in layer only she can perceive:

*Gallery opening June 15*
*You'll be there*
*I can't be*  
*Getting dangerous*
*They're asking questions*
*Stay away from me*
*For your safety*
*Please*
*- H*

For her safety. He's staying away for her safety.

The Holbrook family. Still haunting. Still making him invisible.

---

## Month Nineteen: The Decision

[Tick-tock - lease ending]

Her apartment lease ends in thirty days. Renew or leave? Stay in Santa Barbara where he might be, or accept he's gone?

She photographs everything she's arranged. Creates a book. "Frequencies Only I Can See." Self-publishes one copy.

Leaves it at the library. On the shelf where they first didn't meet. Where UV paint still ghosts the walls.

Inside cover: "For the ghost who paints in seventeen warms."

---

## Month Twenty: The Return

September 2024.

She comes back because she has to. Because the searching without finding is killing her. Because maybe accepting he's gone is the only way forward.

Doesn't know he's been painting fresh messages.

Doesn't know Maria's been orchestrating.

Doesn't know tomorrow she'll find him.

Tonight, she arranges her entire apartment one last time. Photographs it. Posts with first caption in twenty months:

"Still seeing impossible things."

Across town, in a room she doesn't know exists, Hale sees the post. Sees the arrangement. Sees she's still speaking their language.

Paints on the library wall: *Find me where the water began.*

---

## What They Don't Know

[Free indirect - truth hiding in plain sight]

Pull back. See the pattern:

Every month, they just miss each other.
Every month, they create for each other.
Every month, they choose faith over evidence.

497 arrangements.
497 paintings.
Twenty months of perfect parallel creation.

Tomorrow, the parallel lines converge.

But tonight, they're still searching. Still creating. Still believing in someone who might be imagination.

That faith is about to become sight.

That search is about to end.

Those parallel lines are about to touch.

---

## Month Twenty: The Final Day

**[September 16, 2024 - The Day Before]**

Chloe's packing. Not to leave—her lease auto-renewed while she wasn't paying attention. But packing the search. Four boxes of evidence:

- Hospital wristbands from places she checked
- Lists with Swedish names highlighted
- Photos of UV messages, hundreds
- Maps with red X's marking "not here"
- The book from the library: *Quantum Entanglement*

Maria watches from the doorway. "You're giving up?"

"I'm accepting."

"That he's gone?"

"That I can't find someone who doesn't want to be found."

"You think he doesn't want—?"

"He's protecting me. From the Holbrooks. From the false accusation. From whatever made him invisible in the first place."

"That's bullshit."

"Is it? Twenty months, Maria. If he wanted to be found—"

"He's been leaving messages."

"Old ones. Nothing fresh in two months."

Maria walks to the window. Looks out at campus. "What if he's waiting?"

"For what?"

"For you to stop looking. So he can find you instead."

"That doesn't make sense."

"Neither does any of this. But tomorrow's the seventeenth."

"So?"

"Seventeen. Your number."

Chloe hadn't realized. September 17th. Of course.

"Check the library," Maria says. "One more time."

"Why?"

"Because I asked you to. Because it's where you began. Because—" Maria turns, and there are tears in her eyes. "Because I've been watching you search for twenty months and I can't stand to see you stop when you're so close."

"How do you know I'm close?"

"I just do."

That night, Chloe dreams in seventeen colors. All of them taste like ending. Or beginning. Hard to tell the difference in UV frequencies.

She wakes at 2:15 AM.

Of course she does.

Tomorrow—today—she'll check the library.

One last time.

---

## The Arrangement

**[September 17, 2024 - Morning]**

She arranges her apartment. Can't help it. The compulsion stronger than ever.

Coffee cups in spirals.
Books by color frequency only she can see.
Pencils in patterns that spell messages in tetrachromatic vision.

All of it photographed. Posted to Instagram with no caption.

Within minutes, comments:

*Still watching - Stockholm*
*Beautiful frequency - Seattle*
*The pattern continues - Anonymous*

Her network of invisible artists. All responding. All seeing something in her arrangements.

But not him. Never him directly.

Or—

She looks closer at the Stockholm comment. No profile picture. Account created today.

Her heart races.

She clicks.

Account doesn't exist.

Deleted already.

But Stockholm. Hale mentioned Stockholm once. His mother worked with Karolinska Institute.

Another breadcrumb? Another ghost?

Her phone rings. Dr. Chen's office. Her therapy appointment. She'd forgotten.

"I need to cancel," she says.

"Ms. Martinez, you've cancelled three times—"

"I know. I'm sorry. Something came up."

"Your tetrachromatic episodes?"

Episodes. Like her vision is a medical condition. Like seeing hundred million colors is pathology.

"Yes," she lies. Easier than explaining.

"We're concerned about the compulsive arranging—"

She hangs up.

No more therapy. No more trying to be normal. No more pretending she doesn't see what she sees.

Today she's going to the library.

Today she's going to find him.

Or finally accept he's unfindable.

Either way, today something ends.

---

## The Messages Everywhere

**[September 17, 2024 - Afternoon]**

On the way to campus, she sees them:

UV messages on every surface.

Not old ones.

Fresh.

Still tacky when she touches the one on the bus stop.

*Almost there - H*

Her heart stops. H. He never signs H anymore. Too dangerous. Too identifying.

Another on the sidewalk:

*Same time same place - H*

Another on a tree:

*Trust the frequencies - H*

He's here. He's been here. Today. Hours ago. Minutes maybe.

She runs.

Campus security shouts something about authorized access only but she doesn't stop.

The library.

Through the doors.

Past the desk where they first didn't meet.

Down to the basement.

And there—

Oh.

Oh, the walls.

Covered. Every inch. UV paint in patterns that make her tetrachromacy sing.

Not words.

Art.

Abstract but not. She can see it—their story painted in frequencies:

- The first unconscious responses (purple spirals)
- Three years of searching without knowing (gold lines)
- The flood (blue-black waves)
- Eight hours in the tower (seventeen silver bursts)
- The kiss (red-white explosion)
- Twenty months apart (parallel lines, never touching)
- Today (the lines converging)

And in the center, in paint so fresh it's still wet:

*Turn around*

She turns around.
