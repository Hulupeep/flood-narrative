# Voices in Color
*September 18, 2024 - Evening After Coffee Meeting*

---

## Part 1: The Amplified Perception

Her apartment walls pulse with colors that don't exist.

Not hallucination. Not imagination. The coffee meeting—touching him, confirming seventeen warms, tasting their connection—amplified everything beyond previous limits. Like her four cones got upgraded to five, six, seventeen. Like touching him rewired her neural pathways to perceive frequencies that physics hasn't discovered.

She sits at her kitchen table, watching reality shimmer. Northwest corner: pearl-silver-violet spreading like slow lightning. East wall: copper-green waves that taste like electricity. Ceiling: gold fractals that shouldn't be visible but blazed into existence the moment she got home.

The phone sits in front of her. His number glowing in screen-light that fractures into forty-three different blues—each one a different emotional temperature. She's been staring at it for seventeen minutes. Always seventeen when it comes to him.

Call? Text? Wait?

Her hands move without permission, arranging items on the table—salt shaker, pepper mill, sugar bowl, her coffee mug from this afternoon that still smells like him somehow. The arrangement creates its own color: purple-gold static that tastes like the moment before lightning strikes.

"Jesus, Chloe, you okay?"

Emma, her roommate. Standing in the doorway with concern painting her face orange-pink (worry-color, friend-color, the color of normal people caring about abnormal people).

"Fine."

"You've been sitting there for twenty minutes just... staring."

"Seventeen minutes."

"What?"

"Seventeen. Not twenty."

Emma comes closer. "Are you high? Did coffee-date guy drug you?"

"No. Maybe. Not with drugs."

"That's not reassuring."

"I'm fine. Just... seeing things differently."

"Your tetrachromacy thing?"

Emma knows the basics. That Chloe sees more colors. Safe version. Not the full truth about UV messages and impossible frequencies and someone who paints in her exact wavelengths.

"Yeah. But more. After today it's—"

The phone rings.

His number.

The ringtone creates cascading colors that shouldn't exist—sound becoming light becoming taste becoming—

"You going to answer that?" Emma asks.

Chloe answers.

---

## Part 2: The Voice That Paints

"Hale?"

"You see them now. The colors. In your apartment."

Not a question. Statement. He knows.

His voice through the phone creates synesthetic cascade her brain can barely process:
- Swedish accent = silver-blue frequency at 467.3 nanometers
- Exhaustion = purple underscore at 380 nanometers  
- Hope = gold overtone at 570 nanometers
- Seventeen different emotional temperatures she can somehow hear
- All of it combining into sound-color that makes her teeth ache with beauty

"How do you know?"

"Because same happened to me. After tower. After touching you. Your frequency everywhere. Leaked into universe. Stained everything."

"For twenty months?"

"Twenty months. Got stronger after yesterday. After reunion. After confirming you're real."

Emma mimes "I'll give you privacy" and heads to her room, but not before mouthing "Hot Swedish guy?" with exaggerated eyebrow waggle.

Chloe nods, though "hot" doesn't begin to describe someone whose voice creates colors that shouldn't exist.

"Describe what you're seeing," he says. "Right now. Your walls."

She looks. Really looks with whatever her perception has become.

"Northwest corner. Pearl-silver-violet spreading like... like slow lightning? No, like... like water moving upward. Defying gravity. Frequency about 478 nanometers but shifted into UV. Tastes like mint and copper and—" She stops. "This sounds insane."

"Keep going."

"East wall. Copper-green waves. Not moving but implying movement. Like... kinetic potential frozen in color."

"What temperature?"

"The color?"

"Yes."

She doesn't question how color has temperature. With him, everything has everything.

"Ninety-three point seven degrees."

"Fahrenheit?"

"Celsius."

"That's impossible. Would be visible heat."

"Everything about us is impossible."

"Yes." His voice does something—shifts frequency, creates new color through the phone. "But real."

---

## Part 3: The Unconscious Conversation

"You're arranging something," he says suddenly. "While we talk."

She looks down. Her free hand has been organizing paper clips from the jar. Spiral pattern. Seventeen clips in perfect mathematical progression. She didn't notice doing it.

"How did you—?"

"Because I'm painting. Same spiral. Right now. Without meaning to."

"What?"

"My hand. Is moving. Creating spiral. Seventeen loops. Same pattern you're making."

"That's—"

"Impossible. I know. But look at your paper clips."

She does. The spiral follows golden ratio. Fibonacci sequence. But more—in UV spectrum visible only to her, the clips create pattern that pulls at her chest like gravity.

"We're still having the conversation," she says.

"Twenty months of conversation. Even separated."

"Even now. On phone."

"Especially now. Distance doesn't stop it. Just changes frequency."

She adds another paper clip. Feels him add another paint stroke three miles away. Their hands moving in synchronization despite separation.

"This is terrifying," she says.

"Yes."

"And beautiful."

"Yes."

"And I don't want it to stop."

"No. Me neither."

---

## Part 4: The Scars Story

"Tell me about the scars," she says. "The ones painted with UV."

Long pause. His breathing creates colors through the phone—inhale is blue-silver at 440 Hz, exhale is gold-green at 528 Hz. She could paint his respiratory pattern if she knew how to paint.

"Month six. June. When searching failed. When I accepted you were gone."

"But you kept painting."

"Differently. On myself. Where only you could see if you existed."

"Why scars underneath?"

Another pause. She hears him set down his brush—the tiny click creates purple splash in her vision.

"Needed to mark it. The losing. The absence. Scars for grief. But then—"

"What?"

"Realized scars alone were just pain. Needed to transform them. Make them mean something else. So painted over them. UV messages. For you. If you ever found me. Evidence of waiting."

"Seventeen scars."

"You counted. At coffee."

"I count everything. Especially you."

His laugh looks golden through the phone. Not metaphor—literal synesthetic translation. Golden with edges of silver-sad at 470.5 nanometers.

"What number am I now?" he asks.

She's already calculating. Adding every temperature, every frequency, every impossible color he creates:

"Still infinite. But more infinite than this morning."

"Infinity can't increase."

"Ours can. Gets more infinite every time we talk. Every pattern we create. Every impossible thing we prove real."

"Sustainable infinity?"

"Daily infinity. Tuesday infinity. Regular life infinity."

"I like that better than emergency infinity."

"Me too."

---

## Part 5: The Tower Memory Test

"Tell me something only we would know," she says. "From that night. Prove this is real."

"The kiss tasted like ending but looked like beginning."

"Anyone could guess that."

"No. You said specific words. After. When water stopped rising. You said: 'The kiss tastes like copper-mint-snow and looks like geometry that shouldn't exist.'"

Her breath catches. Those exact words. Her synesthetic description that made no sense but perfect sense.

"What else?"

"You counted. While we waited for rescue. Ninety-three. Over and over."

"Ninety-three what?"

"Different shades of black in darkness. You said darkness has colors too. That I looked like 'light that gave up being bright but found new way to shine.'"

Every word correct. Every impossible description. He memorized her tetrachromatic perceptions perfectly.

"You really remember."

"Everything. Every color you described. Every pattern you saw. Every impossible thing you said. Memorized like prayer. Like map. Like promise I'd find you."

"But you didn't find me. I found you."

"We found each other. Through art. Through frequencies. Through impossible made visible."

"That's very Swedish of you."

"What?"

"Making it mutual. Egalitarian. No hero narrative."

"You want hero narrative?"

"No. Want true narrative. We saved each other. Are still saving each other."

"From what?"

"From being only ones who see impossible things."

---

## Part 6: Emma's Interruption

Emma's door opens. She peeks out, sees Chloe still on phone.

"Sorry," she whispers. "But the kitchen is doing something weird."

"What?"

"The spices. They're... arranged? Did you do that?"

Chloe looks. The entire spice rack reorganized by color frequency. Twenty-three jars in perfect gradient from white pepper to black cardamom. Her unconscious response to whatever Hale's painting.

"I'll call you back," she tells Hale.

"No, stay on. Want to hear this."

Emma approaches the spice rack. "This is like... art? But also math? The progression is perfect."

"It's how I think," Chloe says.

"While on the phone? Unconsciously?"

"Apparently."

"That's..."

"Weird. I know."

"I was going to say impressive. Can you do my closet next?"

Chloe laughs. The sound has color—surprised-gold with relief-silver edges.

"Who's that?" Hale asks through phone.

"Roommate. Emma."

"She sees the patterns?"

"The obvious ones. Not the frequencies. Not the real arrangement."

"There's more?"

"There's always more. Seventeen layers minimum."

Emma shakes her head. "You're talking to him about the arrangement? While making the arrangement?"

"It's complicated."

"Apparently." Emma grabs crackers from the counter. "I'll leave you to your... whatever this is. Tetrachromatic phone sex?"

"Emma!"

"What? The way you're looking at that spice rack is definitely intimate."

She leaves. Chloe's face burns—embarrassment creating its own heat signature she can actually see in peripheral vision. Pink-red at exactly 98.7 degrees.

"She sounds fun," Hale says.

"She doesn't understand but tries."

"That's all we can ask from people."

"Is it enough?"

"Has to be. Unless we want to only talk to each other forever."

"That doesn't sound terrible."

"No. But limiting. We have things to show world."

"Speaking of the world—" she hesitates. "I saw something online today. Old forum posts about you. From the rumors."

"Gavin Keane."

"You know about him?"

"Know what he did. What it led to."

"The prayer space?"

Long pause. When he speaks, his voice carries colors she's never heard before—gray-silver-black, the frequencies of trauma and injustice.

"January 2023. Week after his rumors started spreading..."

---

## Part 7: The Vandalism

*[January 24, 2023 - Two Weeks After Car Park]*

The Multifaith Prayer Space sits in the heart of the Student Life building. Quiet sanctuary where all beliefs converge—Christian crosses, Islamic crescents, Jewish Stars of David, Hindu OM symbols, Buddhist wheels, indigenous medicine wheels. A rainbow of faith traditions coexisting in careful balance.

Someone violated it on a Tuesday night.

Not with paint. With fluorescent dye. The kind used in emergency lighting, invisible to normal vision but blazing under UV.

Campus security discovered it Wednesday morning when the UV emergency fixtures flickered on during a fire drill. Suddenly, the sacred space blazed with crude symbols—not religious iconography but something uglier. Swastikas. Confederate flags. Slurs in multiple languages.

And in the corner, barely visible: "UV ARTIST WAS HERE"

Within hours, the connection spreads like digital wildfire:
- "UV artist" = invisible painter on campus  
- Invisible painter = Hale Lindqvist, extremist maintenance worker
- Therefore: Hale committed hate crime

No evidence needed. The logic feels airtight.

Campus emails flood inboxes:
*"Regarding the incident at the Multifaith Prayer Space..."*
*"Counseling services available for affected students..."*
*"Security measures being reviewed..."*

Student groups mobilize. Petitions circulate. Vigils organize.

**"Remove Hale Lindqvist from campus immediately"**
**"No safe space for extremist employees"**
**"Protect our community from UV vandalism"**

The signatures accumulate like digital evidence. Gavin's screenshots from January resurface, shared thousands of times. The car-park incident becomes "aggressive confrontation." The hit-and-run narrative solidifies into campus mythology.

Hale learns about it the way most victims discover their vilification—through a supervisor's awkward conversation.

"Look, Lindqvist, we need to talk."

He's mopping the engineering building, 2 AM shift, when Security Chief Rodriguez appears with uncomfortable body language.

"About what?"

"The prayer space thing. People are saying—"

"I didn't do it."

"I know. But people are saying you did. And with your... history."

"Charges were dropped."

"Doesn't matter. Perception is reality now. Social media age."

Rodriguez explains the situation: 847 signatures on the removal petition. Parents calling. Alumni donors expressing "concerns." The Chancellor's office asking questions.

"Can you prove you didn't do it?"

"Can you prove anyone else did?"

"That's not how this works anymore."

They put him on administrative leave. Not fired—too many legal complications. Not suspended—no formal charges. Just... absent. Invisible in a different way.

His maintenance access gets revoked. Key card deactivated. Locker cleaned out.

The UV paints in his apartment become evidence of capability rather than art. Doesn't matter that the dye used in the prayer space was different spectrum, different chemical composition. Doesn't matter that his paintings never contained hate symbols, never targeted religious spaces.

UV + extremism rumors = guilty by association.

He spends the end of January 2023 in his apartment, looking at four hundred and thirteen paintings he can no longer add to, knowing Chloe sees new arrangements on Instagram while he can't respond.

The conversation stops because he can't access campus.

The silence between them grows because someone else decided to weaponize light itself.

By February, the real vandal is caught. Security cameras finally reviewed, traced the dye purchase to a student credit card. Derek Kowalski—name that would later surface in connection with other campus incidents involving stolen art and forged documents. Someone with access, motivation, and protection from within the university system.

But the damage is done. Hale's name remains connected to extremism in search results. The rumors fossilize into digital permanent record.

Even when cleared, he stays on leave. Even when offered his job back, he declines. Some stains don't wash out.

He starts painting in storage units. Abandoned buildings. Spaces where no one can accuse him of vandalism because no one claims them.

The conversation continues, but now it's truly invisible—hidden from the world that decided he was dangerous for seeing in frequencies others couldn't detect.

That's January-February 2023.

## Part 8: The Plan

*[September 18, 2024 - Present Day]*

"Tomorrow," he says. "Library. Where we met yesterday."

"Why?"

"Want to show you something. All the paintings. From twenty months. Have them stored. Documented. Our entire unconscious conversation."

"All of them?"

"Four hundred ninety-seven paintings. Photographed. Dated. Matched to your Instagram posts."

"You matched them?"

"Last night. After coffee. Couldn't sleep. Needed to prove to myself the pattern was real."

"And?"

"Perfect correlation. Every arrangement you posted, I responded to within hours. Without knowing. We were having conversation across city, across time, across impossibility."

"Why show me?"

"Because—" His voice shifts, creates new color through phone. Color she's never seen before. Amber-gold-silver with UV edges. Color that might be love if love existed in visible spectrum. "Because we can make something. Together. That no one else can make."

"Art?"

"More. Language. For colors without names. For connections that shouldn't exist. For love that paints itself in frequencies."

She sees it suddenly—not imagination but actual perception of probability:
- Gallery of impossible art only they can fully see
- Others with tetrachromacy finding them, knowing they're not alone
- Language expanding to hold new colors
- Love becoming visible through art
- Future painted in frequencies science hasn't discovered

"Ten AM?" she asks.

"Ten. And Chloe?"

"Yeah?"

"Wear something with color. Real color. Want to see how many you contain."

"How many do you think?"

"Infinite. But counting will be fun."

"You want to count my colors?"

"Want to map them. Memorize them. Paint them. Make them visible to everyone."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible. Hasn't stopped us yet."

---

## Part 8: The Night Colors

They hang up eventually. Have to. She needs to sleep. He needs to paint. Life needs to continue beyond phone calls that create new colors.

But her apartment has transformed. Not just his colors now—theirs. The combination creating something beyond either alone. The walls pulse with shared frequency that tastes like future.

Emma returns, stops in doorway.

"Okay, what the hell?"

"What?"

"You're glowing."

"I'm not—"

"Not literally. But like... your whole apartment looks different. Brighter? More colorful? Did you change the lights?"

"No."

"Then what?"

"I talked to someone who sees what I see."

"Another tetrachromat?"

"No. He sees different impossibilities. But they match mine."

"That makes no sense."

"Nothing about us makes sense. But it's real."

Emma walks through the apartment, examining. "You arranged everything. While on the phone. Not just spices. Everything."

Chloe looks. She's right. Books reorganized by color frequency. Dishes stacked in spectrum order. Even the furniture subtly shifted to create better angles for light.

"It's how we talk," she says.

"Through furniture arrangement?"

"Through everything. Colors. Patterns. Art. Frequencies that shouldn't exist."

"Sounds complicated."

"It's the simplest thing in the world."

And it is. Despite impossible colors. Despite twenty months apart. Despite speaking in spectrums.

Simple:
- Two people seeing each other in dimensions others can't perceive
- Two people creating language for impossible things  
- Two people proving love exists in frequencies science hasn't named

---

## Part 9: The Text Conversation

Her phone buzzes. Text from him.

"Your apartment walls still pulsing?"

"Stronger now. Like they're breathing."

"What color?"

She looks. Tries to describe. "Color that doesn't exist yet. Like... if hope and physics had a baby."

"That would be us."

"What?"

"Hope and physics creating impossible baby."

"That's terrible metaphor."

"English isn't first language."

"Your English is perfect."

"Not when trying to describe you. No language is sufficient for your frequencies."

She's about to respond when another text arrives. A photo. His studio. Every surface covered in paintings—UV and visible light combined. All of them attempting to capture something.

"Is that—"

"You. All you. Twenty months of painting you without knowing."

She enlarges the photo. Even through phone screen, even without full UV visibility, she can see it. The same frequency she broadcasts. The same impossible colors she contains.

"How?"

"Don't know. Just knew what colors felt right. What patterns needed to exist. Painted them. Now I know they were all you."

"That's—"

"Impossible. Insane. Beautiful. True. All of it."

"Yes."

Another photo. Close-up of one painting. Today's date. Her coffee cup arrangement from this afternoon transformed into art that makes her chest ache.

"When did you paint this?"

"While we talked. Couldn't stop hand from moving."

"We're still doing it. The unconscious conversation."

"Not unconscious anymore. Just conversation in language we're inventing."

"What language?"

"Color. Frequency. Pattern. Touch. Everything beyond words."

She photographs her arranged apartment. Sends it. 

"Beautiful," he texts immediately. "See you in everything."

"Is that good or terrifying?"

"Both. Best things always are."

---

## Part 10: Sleep in Impossible Colors

She should sleep. It's past midnight. Tomorrow (today now) she meets him at library. Sees twenty months of invisible conversation. Begins making impossible art together.

But sleep feels wrong when her apartment pulses with new frequencies. When her phone contains his voice transformed to color. When tomorrow holds possibility of making invisible visible.

Emma stumbles out for water. Sees Chloe still awake.

"You need to sleep."

"Can't. Too much color."

"That's not a thing."

"It is for me."

Emma sits beside her. Friend-warmth radiating at exactly 98.6 degrees normal human temperature. Comforting in its simplicity.

"Is this going to be your new normal? Arranging everything and seeing impossible things?"

"Maybe."

"And hot Swedish guy?"

"Hale. His name is Hale."

"And Hale is part of new normal?"

"Hale IS the new normal. Or makes normal impossible. Or makes impossible normal."

"You really like him."

"I really see him. And he sees me. In frequencies nobody else can perceive."

"That's either most romantic thing ever or sign you both need therapy."

"We're both in therapy. Therapists think we're trauma-bonding."

"Are you?"

"Maybe. But also more. Also real. Also sustainable. Also daily. Also forever."

Emma hugs her. The contact creates brief color-burst—friendship rendered visible in pink-gold pulse.

"I'm happy for you. Even if I don't understand any of it."

"Thanks."

"Now sleep. You need to be rested for tomorrow's impossible art date."

Chloe goes to bed. Lies in darkness that isn't dark—seventeen shades of black each pulsing with different frequency. Closes her eyes. Still sees colors. His colors. Their colors. Tomorrow's colors waiting to be born.

Her phone buzzes once more.

"Sleep in impossible colors, Chloe. Dream in frequencies we'll make real."

She does.

Dreams of galleries where UV light makes love visible. Of language expanded to hold their connection. Of two people who shouldn't exist but do, creating art from the impossible space between them.

Tomorrow they begin.

Tonight she sleeps surrounded by proof that some things transcend distance, that love leaks into universe and stains everything, that morning will bring reunion with someone whose voice paints colors that physics hasn't discovered.

The walls pulse with their shared frequency.

The impossible becomes daily.

The invisible prepares to be seen.
