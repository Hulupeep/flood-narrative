# Four Hundred Ninety-Seven
*March 2023 to September 2024 - Twenty Months Apart*

---

## Month One: The Lists

Chloe's apartment looks like a detective's evidence board. 

Every survivor list printed, taped to walls. Swedish names highlighted in yellow (twelve different yellows to her tetrachromatic eyes). Norwegian names in blue (thirty-seven blues). Anything that might be misheard, misspelled, mistranscribed.

"This is insane," Maria says from the doorway. "Chloe, you have to stop."

"Lars Holbrook. Lars Holberg. Lars Holstrom. They all sound similar if you're typing fast."

"Honey—"

"Or if his accent was thick. If he was hypothermic. If the person entering data didn't care about accuracy."

"It's been a month."

"So?"

"So if he wanted to find you—"

"Maybe he can't. Maybe he's in hospital. Maybe—"

"Maybe he's dead."

The words hang like UV paint—invisible to most but blazing to those who can see, each letter pulsing at 365 nanometers, tasting of metal and possibility, warm against skin even in the absence of touch.

"He's not dead."

"How do you know?"

Chloe doesn't answer. How to explain that she still feels the seventeen warms sometimes? That certain objects pulse with heat signatures that shouldn't exist? That her compulsion to arrange things has intensified, like she's responding to something?

She photographs the wall of lists. Posts it to Instagram without caption. Her followers think it's art about grief.

Somewhere across town, Hale sees it on a library computer (no phone, too trackable). The arrangement of papers matches the UV painting he did last night. Same spiral pattern. Same mathematical relationships.

He doesn't understand why, but he paints a response on a bathroom wall—UV frequencies that smell like ozone and electrical storms, that taste silver-sharp against the air, invisible to everyone but singing in wavelengths that make fluorescent lights stutter.

They're already talking without knowing.

---

## Month Three: The Therapy Session

"You're making progress," Dr. Chen says.

The office smells like vanilla candles and professional sympathy. Chloe sits in the carefully neutral chair, performing recovery.

"The dreams are less frequent," she says. True.

"And the person you mentioned? The maintenance man?"

"I'm starting to think he might have been—" The words taste like copper lies. "Maybe not entirely real."

"Trauma can create vivid hallucinations. Especially in life-threatening situations."

"Right."

"The brain seeks connection, meaning, purpose in chaos. It's natural to create—"

Chloe's not listening. She's arranging Dr. Chen's pens by frequency. Twelve pens, but infinite gradations of black ink, each with its own molecular signature—carbon black mixed with titanium dioxide creating blue-silver undertones that taste like winter mornings, lampblack with iron oxide producing warm copper shadows that hum at frequencies just below hearing.

"Chloe?"

"Sorry. What?"

"The arranging behavior. We should work on that."

"It helps me think."

"It seems compulsive."

"It's not—" But how to explain? It's not compulsive. It's responsive. Like her hands know something her mind doesn't.

"Let's try an exercise. Mix them up."

Dr. Chen scrambles the pens. Chloe's chest tightens. Wrong. They're wrong. The frequencies clash, create discord her synesthesia translates as nails on chalkboard.

"How does that feel?"

"Fine," Chloe lies.

"You seem distressed."

"I'm fine."

"It's okay to not be fine. That's why you're here."

But she's not here for therapy. She's here because the university requires it for flood survivors. She's here to seem normal enough that people stop worrying. Stop watching. Let her search in peace.

"Can I—" She gestures at the pens.

"Go ahead."

She arranges them. Not by color visible to Dr. Chen but by frequencies only she can see. The pattern matches something. Some response to something. She doesn't know what.

Three miles away, Hale arranges paint tubes in his studio. Same pattern. Same compulsion. Same unconscious conversation.

"Tell me about your mother," Dr. Chen says.

"What about her?"

"She had similar behaviors. The arranging. The claiming to see things others couldn't."

"It's not the same."

"How is it different?"

*Because hers were symptoms. Mine are abilities.*

"I don't see things that aren't there," Chloe says carefully. "I see things that are there but others can't perceive."

"That's a interesting distinction."

"It's an important one."

"Why?"

"Because—" Chloe stops. She almost said: *Because someone else sees them too.* 

"Because?"

"Because I'm not sick. I'm just different."

Dr. Chen writes something. Probably: *Resistance to treatment. Possible delusional framework.*

"Have you been taking the medication we discussed?"

"The anxiety medication? Yes." Another lie. The pills would dull her color perception. Make her normal. Make her blind to UV messages if they exist.

"Good. And you've stopped looking for this person?"

"I've stopped the active searching."

Technically true. She's not actively searching. She's passively broadcasting. Every arrangement a beacon. Every pattern a call.

"That's progress."

Is it? Or is it just learning to hide better?

---

## Month Six: The Breaking Point

**Chloe's apartment, 2 AM:**

She can't sleep. Never can anymore. The darkness has colors—ninety-three shades of black, each one a different frequency of absence.

She gets up. Starts arranging. Everything she owns. Books by color. Dishes by size and hue. Clothes in spectrum formation.

Her phone rings. Maria.

"I know you're awake."

"How?"

"You posted seventeen photos in the last hour."

Seventeen. Always seventeen.

"I can't sleep."

"I'm coming over."

"Don't—"

"Too late. Already in my car."

Maria arrives with coffee and determination.

"This has to stop."

"What?"

"This." She gestures at the apartment. "It looks like a color-coded crime scene."

"It helps me think."

"About him?"

"About everything."

"Chloe, honey, I need you to hear this. He's gone."

"You don't know that."

"Twenty-three Swedish males were rescued from campus. I checked. None named Hale or Lars or anything close."

"The records could be wrong—"

"All twenty-three have been accounted for. Families contacted. Everyone found."

"Then he wasn't counted as Swedish. Maybe they—"

"Chloe." Maria takes her hands. "You have to let him go."

"I can't."

"Why?"

"Because—" How to explain? "Because I still feel him. Creating things. I arrange, and somewhere someone responds. I know how it sounds."

"It sounds like grief."

"It's not grief. It's communication."

"With a ghost?"

"With someone who's as lost as I am."

Maria's quiet for a moment. Then: "Show me."

"What?"

"Show me this communication."

Chloe pulls up her Instagram. Scrolls through twenty months of arrangements. Then creates a split screen with images she's found—graffiti, urban art, weird patterns people post.

"Look at the dates."

Maria looks. "They match. Sort of."

"Not sort of. Exactly. Every time I post, within hours, someone creates something similar."

"That's—coincidence. Confirmation bias."

"Four hundred ninety-seven times?"

"You counted?"

"I count everything."

Maria studies the patterns. Even without tetrachromacy, she can see something. Rhythm. Call and response.

"This is crazy."

"I know."

"But?"

"But what if it's also real?"

**Meanwhile - Hale's studio, same night:**

He can't sleep either. Paints on his own skin—seventeen parallel lines with UV ink where no one will see. Under clothes. Under visible life.

His phone rings. Tommy from the lab.

"You're painting again."

"How do you know?"

"Your light's on. Has been every night this week."

"So?"

"So what are you painting?"

"Nothing."

"Bull. You only paint at 2 AM when it's important."

"It's not—"

"Is it her? The one you're looking for?"

Hale's quiet.

"It is. You're still painting for her."

"She might be dead."

"Or she might be looking for you too."

"With wrong name. Wrong information."

"So make yourself findable."

"I can't. The accusation—"

"Was false. Everyone knows that now."

"But it's still on record. Background checks. If I make myself visible—"

"You stay invisible. Both of you, probably. Hiding from the same things."

"What do you suggest?"

"Stop hiding. Start broadcasting."

"I am broadcasting. Every painting—"

"In UV. Where no one can see."

"Where she can see. If she exists."

"Big if."

"It's all I have."

Tommy's quiet. Then: "The anniversary's coming up."

"I know."

"You going to the campus memorial?"

"Too visible."

"She might be there."

"Or she might not exist."

"Only one way to find out."

But Hale doesn't go. Paints instead. Messages in UV on every surface he can find. Four hundred ninety-seven paintings that all say the same thing:

*I'm still here.*  
*Still looking.*  
*Still creating for you.*

## Month Nine: The UC Berkeley Lab

"Extraordinary," Dr. Martinez says, watching the results. "Absolutely extraordinary."

Chloe sits in the perception lab, electrodes attached to her temples, staring at what looks like a white screen. But she's identified 307 distinct colors in it. The computer confirms—her eyes are processing frequencies the equipment can barely detect.

"True tetrachromacy with extended UV perception. We should publish immediately."

"No."

"No? Dr. Martinez—Ms. Martinez—this would revolutionize our understanding of human color perception."

"I need to think about it."

"What's to think about? You'd be famous in the field. Lectures, research positions—"

"Visible."

"Yes, visible. That's the point."

But visible means findable. And findable means two things:
1. Hale could find her (if he exists, if he's looking)
2. They could medicate her like they did her mother

"My mother," she says. "She had similar abilities."

"Really? Was she tested?"

"In a way. Psychiatric hospital. They said she was hallucinating colors."

"That's different—"

"Is it? If I publish, if I say I see UV messages painted on walls, what happens?"

Dr. Martinez pauses. "The UV messages aren't real."

"How do you know?"

"We've tested. Cameras don't detect them."

"Cameras don't detect what I see in your white screen either."

"That's—that's different."

"Is it?"

Silence.

"Let me document everything," Dr. Martinez says finally. "Privately. No publication yet. But we need record of this."

"Why?"

"Because you're one in seventeen million. Maybe rarer. And if something happens—"

"Like what?"

"Like you disappearing. Like your abilities fading. Like—"

"Like me finding who I'm looking for?"

Dr. Martinez looks at her sharply. "There's someone else? With similar abilities?"

"Maybe. I don't know."

"If there were two of you—two tetrachromats with UV perception—"

"We'd be worth studying."

"You'd be proof that it's genetic. Inheritable. Real."

"We'd be lab rats."

"You'd be miracles."

Chloe doesn't respond. She's arranging the lab equipment by frequency. The pattern feels like response to something. Always responding to something she can't see.

"Three months," she says finally. "Document everything for three months. Then I decide about publication."

"Fair."

But three months later, she'll be arranging stones at the lagoon. Still searching. Still invisible. Still lost.

Dr. Martinez will have 500 pages of documentation no one will ever see.

---

## Month Twelve: The Anniversary

**January 9, 2024 - The Lagoon**

One year.

The lagoon's been drained and rebuilt. Sanitized. No trace of disaster except in the bodies that remember.

Chloe sits on new bench in old spot. The memorial service was this morning—speeches about resilience, healing, moving forward. She didn't go. Couldn't perform public grief when her private grief is that no one else remembers him.

She arranges pencils on the bench. Forty-seven of them, making a pattern she doesn't consciously plan. Her hands know what to do.

"Still at it?"

She looks up. Brad from the tower. She hasn't seen him since that night.

"Brad. Hi."

"Thought that was you. The arranging thing." He sits uninvited. "How've you been?"

"Fine. You?"

"Therapy twice a week. Medication. The works." He laughs bitterly. "I still can't shower with the door closed."

"I'm sorry."

"What about you? Any lasting effects?"

*I see impossible colors. I arrange things compulsively. I'm searching for someone who might not exist.*

"Some," she says.

"That guy," Brad says suddenly. "The Swedish one. You two were—whatever you were. Did you ever find him?"

Her heart stops. "You remember him?"

"Hard to forget. The way you two looked at each other while we were drowning. Like you were seeing colors the rest of us couldn't."

If only he knew.

"No," she says. "Never found him."

"I'm sorry."

"He might not have been real. Trauma response."

"Bullshit."

"What?"

"I was there. He was real. That thing between you was real. Don't let them therapize it away."

"Brad—"

"I asked Jennifer about him. From the tower? She said his name got recorded wrong. Some mix-up with another guy's name."

"Holbrook. Or Holberg."

"You've been looking."

"For a year."

"With the wrong name."

"With no name. With nothing."

Brad's quiet. Then: "The UV paint."

"What?"

"He painted in UV, right? That's what you kept saying. During the flood."

"You remember that?"

"I remember everything from that night. Every word. Every color." He pauses. "I don't have what you have. The seeing thing. But I remember you saying the walls were covered in UV paint only you could see."

"Yes."

"So look for UV paint."

"Where?"

"Everywhere. If he's alive, if he's looking for you, he'd paint where you could find it."

"That's—"

"Crazy? Everything about that night was crazy. But you two found each other through invisible art once. Why not again?"

He leaves her there with her pencils arranged in a pattern that means something she doesn't understand.

**Same Day - Storke Tower**

Hale stands in the rebuilt carillon room. They gave him access—he's maintenance, invisible, trusted with keys.

He's painted something on the ceiling. Where the old message was: "Love persists in frequencies beyond visible."

His addition: *Still true.*

And below that, smaller: *Four hundred days. Still looking.*

He doesn't know she's sitting at the lagoon, less than a mile away, arranging pencils in the exact pattern of his ceiling painting.

They're so close. Parallel grieving. Parallel creating. Parallel missing each other by geography and bad timing and wrong names.

## Month Fifteen: The Airport Near-Miss

**Seattle-Tacoma International Airport**  
**April 17, 2024, 2:47 PM**

Chloe has three hours between flights. Conference on color perception was worthless—no one else seeing what she sees. No one else even believes it's possible.

She wanders the terminal. Sees an art supply store. Goes in.

The cashier—pierced, painted, looks like someone who'd understand invisible art—is organizing UV markers.

"Weird question," Chloe says. "Do you get people asking about tetrachromatic-responsive paints?"

The cashier looks up sharply. "Actually, yeah. Like twenty minutes ago."

The world stops.

"What?"

"Swedish guy. Tall. Paint under his fingernails. Was asking about paints that only show up under specific wavelengths."

Twenty minutes.

"What did he look like?"

"Uh, blonde? Green eyes? Seemed kind of desperate, honestly. Bought like two hundred dollars worth of UV markers."

"Which way did he go?"

"Toward C gates. Said something about Stockholm flight."

Chloe runs.

**2:52 PM - C Gates**

Forty-seven gates. She starts at C1.

"Excuse me, the Stockholm flight?"

"C23. But it's—"

She's already running.

**2:58 PM - C23**

"The Stockholm flight?"

"Just closed the door. Sorry."

"Can you—can you check the manifest? Hale Lindqvist?"

"I can't share passenger information."

"Please. It's—someone's dying. Family emergency."

The gate agent softens. Types.

"No one by that name."

"Lars? Lars anything?"

"No Lars. Sorry."

Of course not. Wrong name. Always wrong name.

**3:15 PM - Security Office**

"I need to see security footage."

"That's not—ma'am, are you okay?"

She's crying. Didn't realize.

"Someone was here. Twenty minutes before me. Swedish. Tall. Bought UV markers."

"And?"

"And I need to know if it was—if he was—"

"Ma'am, we can't show footage without cause."

"I have cause. I've been looking for someone for fifteen months."

"That's not—"

"Please."

But they don't show her. Can't. Rules.

**3:47 PM - Her Gate**

She sits at B12, waiting for Denver flight. Opens Instagram. Posts photo of the UV markers she bought. Caption: "Twenty minutes too late. Story of my life."

**Meanwhile - Flight to Stockholm**

But Hale's not on the Stockholm flight.

He's at D36, waiting for Vancouver connection. Different direction entirely. The cashier misheard or misunderstood or just guessed wrong.

He scrolls through Instagram on airport WiFi. Sees her post about UV markers. Doesn't recognize the username (she changed it after the flood). Doesn't know she was there.

Twenty minutes that might have changed everything.

Instead, they fly in opposite directions, both still searching, both still creating, both still missing each other by margins that feel like fate but might just be bad timing.

---

## Month Eighteen: The Almost Acceptance

**July 2024 - Chloe's Apartment**

"You look good," Maria says. "Healthier."

Chloe has learned to perform recovery better. Smiles at right times. Stopped talking about him. Arranges things only when alone.

"I'm doing better."

"The searching?"

"I've stopped."

Lie. She's systematized it. Automated Google alerts. Instagram hashtag tracking. UV light purchases in art stores.

"Good. That's good."

"I'm thinking about dating again."

Bigger lie. But it's what recovered people say.

"Really? Anyone in mind?"

"There's someone from the perception lab. Another researcher."

"That's great!"

It's not. Dr. Kim is nice, normal, sees regular number of colors. Doesn't paint. Doesn't have seventeen warms. Exists in normal frequencies.

"We're getting coffee Tuesday."

"I'm proud of you."

For what? For giving up? For pretending he was hallucination?

After Maria leaves, Chloe arranges everything again. The pattern more complex now. Eighteen months of unconscious conversation creating language she doesn't understand but can't stop speaking.

She photographs it. Posts it. First time with caption in months:

"Still seeing impossible things."

**Same Night - Hale's Studio**

Tommy visits. Brings beer. Pretends it's casual.

"You're painting again."

"Never stopped."

"I mean really painting. Not just the UV stuff."

"UV stuff is real painting."

"For invisible audience."

"For specific audience."

"Who might be dead."

"Who might be searching too."

Tommy sighs. "It's been eighteen months."

"I know."

"At what point do you accept—"

"Never."

"That's not healthy."

"Neither is forgetting."

"I'm not saying forget. I'm saying move forward."

"I am moving forward. Just with her."

"She's not here."

"She's everywhere. Every pattern I see has her frequency. Every arrangement of objects. I can't explain it."

"You sound—"

"Crazy. I know."

"I was going to say devoted."

Hale looks at him.

"It's kind of beautiful," Tommy continues. "Insane but beautiful. Painting for someone who might not exist."

"She exists."

"How do you know?"

"Because—" How to explain? "Because the patterns are getting stronger. More complex. Like conversation developing vocabulary."

"Show me."

Hale shows him eighteen months of photographs. His paintings. Date stamps. And images he's found online—arrangements, patterns, someone's Instagram he doesn't know is hers.

"They match."

"I know."

"The dates—they're hours apart."

"Sometimes minutes."

"That's—"

"Impossible."

"But real."

"But real."

Tommy drinks his beer. Thinks.

"Make yourself more findable."

"How?"

"Paint bigger. More visible. Stop hiding in UV."

"That's the only place she can see."

"Then paint both. UV and visible. Give her more chances."

"The accusation—"

"Was false. Everyone knows that. James Holbrook is the one hiding now. His father disowned him."

"Really?"

"Really. So stop hiding. Start broadcasting louder."

Three days later, Hale paints the library bathroom. UV message that will bring her back: *Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Find me where the water began.

---

## Month Twenty: The Night Before

**September 15, 2024 - The Breaking Point**

Chloe can't stand it anymore. The searching. The not finding. The almost accepting but never quite.

She arranges her entire apartment. Every object by color frequency. It takes six hours. The result makes no sense unless you have tetrachromacy. Unless you're looking. Unless you're him.

"What are you doing?" Maria asks when she arrives with dinner.

"Creating."

"Creating what?"

"A map."

"To where?"

"To me. If he's looking. If he can see."

"Chloe—"

"I know. But I have to try. One more time."

She photographs it. Posts it. Caption: "Still seeing impossible things."

First caption in months.

The arrangement says:
*I'm still here.*  
*Still looking.*  
*Still believing in impossible frequencies.*

**Same Night - The Library**

Hale can't stand it anymore either. 

Goes to where they first really met. Where she saw his UV gallery. Where everything changed.

Paints new message. Fresh. Desperate. Direct:

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Find me where the water began.

But also paints something else. In regular paint. Visible. Tommy was right—he needs to broadcast louder.

*For C.M. - If you can see this, I can see you seeing.*

Takes photo. Posts to Instagram account he's never used. Tags every UV art hashtag. Every tetrachromacy reference. Every impossible combination.

The faith is about to pay off.

Tomorrow Maria will see the paintings. Will call Chloe. Will say "There's something you need to see."

But tonight, they're still searching. Still creating. Still keeping faith in someone who might be gone.

That faith is about to become sight.

The parallel paths are about to converge.

Four hundred ninety-seven days of unconscious conversation are about to become conscious.

The reunion is three days away.

They just don't know it yet.

## The UV Truth (Private)
*[September 16, 2024 - Next Day]*

Chloe wakes to her phone buzzing. Maria's text: "Meet me at the Marine Science Building. 20 minutes. Don't ask questions."

### Part 1: The Laboratory Discovery

**Marine Science Building, Room 201**  
**11:47 AM**

Dr. Tanaka's lab smells different today. Not just salt and formaldehyde but something else—anticipation mixed with UV ink, invisible to most but blazing to Chloe's tetrachromatic eyes.

"Show her," Maria says to Dr. Tanaka.

"Show me what?"

Dr. Tanaka pulls out a manila envelope marked CONFIDENTIAL. "Your friend brought me something this morning. Said you'd been looking for UV art around campus."

"What kind of something?"

"Photographs. Of bathroom graffiti." Dr. Tanaka looks embarrassed. "I know how that sounds, but—"

She slides out eight photos. Regular camera shots of bathroom walls that look mostly blank except for standard graffiti. But Chloe sees immediately—UV messages blazing like neon in frequencies only she can perceive.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

"Find me where the water began," she translates without thinking.

"You can read it?" Maria asks.

"Swedish. And—" Chloe's voice catches. "And I know this handwriting."

### Part 2: The Spectrum Analysis

Dr. Tanaka sets up her equipment—modified cameras, spectrometers, blacklight arrays. "We need to document this properly. Scientifically."

"Why?"

"Because if someone is painting messages only you can see, we need proof. Evidence that your tetrachromacy isn't just academic curiosity—it's functional. Communicative."

She photographs the bathroom wall samples under different wavelengths. Regular light shows nothing unusual. UV light reveals blazing text. But when she adjusts to the specific frequencies Chloe described seeing...

"Extraordinary," Dr. Tanaka breathes.

Layers upon layers of messages. Not just the recent Swedish text but months—maybe years—of accumulated UV art. All in the same handwriting. All painted with increasingly sophisticated techniques.

"Someone's been perfecting this," Dr. Tanaka says. "Look at the progression."

Earlier messages: crude, simple UV paint that shows up under blacklight.

Recent messages: complex formulations that respond only to tetrachromatic vision, invisible even under standard UV detection.

"He's been learning," Chloe says. "Learning to paint in my frequencies specifically."

"You're sure it's a he?"

"I'm sure it's him."

### Part 3: The Vinyl Evidence Connection

Maria pulls out her phone. "There's more. Remember that email you showed me? From the Finnish record dealer?"

"Dommo? Dominic Marchand?"

"I contacted him. Asked about UV detection methods. Turns out he's been documenting shipping errors for years, and he mentioned something interesting about that record—the Botanical Lathe that was mis-shipped."

She shows Chloe screenshots of Dommo's latest email:

*Ms. Martinez,*

*Regarding your inquiry about UV detection methods: I've been experimenting with spectrum photography for archival purposes. The Botanical Lathe item #003/5 has particularly sophisticated UV layers—not standard blacklight-reactive ink but something more refined.*

*I've included comparison photos taken under different wavelengths. Note the message "EI VÄKIVALLALLE" (No to violence) visible only under specific tetrachromatic-responsive frequencies.*

*If your friend is investigating UV art, these might serve as comparison baseline for authenticity verification.*

*Attached are also photos from the anti-fascist pop-up event in Oulu, 2019. The UV layer was created specifically to be invisible to fascist investigators but visible to those with tetrachromatic perception.*

*Interesting historical note: Only about 12% of women worldwide have true tetrachromacy, making these messages extremely exclusive communication.*

*Best regards,*  
*D. Marchand*

"Twelve percent," Dr. Tanaka says. "Actually it's closer to 2-3% with true functional tetrachromacy. And extending into UV spectrum? You might be one in several million."

"But he's painting specifically for me. Using techniques that only I can see."

"Which means either he has studied tetrachromatic vision extensively, or—"

"Or he knows someone who has it. Someone he's trying to reach."

### Part 4: The Phone Camera Failure

Dr. Tanaka tries to capture the UV messages with her phone camera. The screen shows nothing but ordinary bathroom graffiti.

"Try yours," she suggests to Chloe.

Chloe points her phone at the wall. Through the phone screen: blank wall with standard graffiti. Through her direct vision: blazing UV messages in seventeen different frequencies.

"The cameras can't see it," she realizes. "Even yours can barely detect it with specialized equipment."

"Which means," Maria says slowly, "if someone wanted to prove these messages exist to authorities or administration..."

"They couldn't. No photographic evidence that would hold up."

"Perfect cover," Dr. Tanaka observes. "Invisible to investigation, visible only to intended recipient."

Chloe stares at the messages. The handwriting she recognizes from twenty months ago in the tower. The Swedish words she heard whispered against her ear while water rose around them. The seventeen parallel lines that match her own temperature perception.

"There's something else," Dr. Tanaka says carefully. "About the paint composition."

"What about it?"

"It's not commercial UV paint. It's custom formulated. Expensive. Someone who knows chemistry, who understands exactly which frequencies to target for tetrachromatic perception."

"Artist with science background?"

"Or someone who's been consulting with tetrachromatic researchers."

### Part 5: The Spectrum Mismatch Discovery

Dr. Tanaka pulls out another set of photographs—the vandalized prayer space from months earlier.

"Remember the hate crime incident? The multifaith space vandalized with UV dye?"

"Yes."

"I kept samples for forensic analysis. Look at this."

She shows Chloe side-by-side spectrum analyses. The prayer space vandalism: crude, commercial UV dye visible under blacklight. The bathroom messages: sophisticated, custom-formulated paint visible only to tetrachromatic eyes.

"They're completely different," Chloe breathes.

"Different chemistry. Different technique. Different skill level. Different purpose."

"The vandalism wasn't him."

"Whoever painted these messages" —Dr. Tanaka points to the bathroom walls— "didn't vandalize that prayer space. The techniques are incompatible."

"So when people accused the UV painter of hate crimes..."

"They were blaming the wrong UV painter. Or blaming someone who never painted with UV at all—someone who was set up."

Chloe's hands shake. Evidence. Scientific proof that Hale wasn't responsible for the campus vandalism. That his UV work was completely separate, completely personal, completely for her.

### Part 6: The Dommo Documentation

Maria pulls out printed emails—the complete thread with Dominic Marchand.

"He sent more. Look."

*Additional information regarding UV authenticity verification:*

*The Botanical Lathe sleeve art was created by collective called "Valkoinen Vastarinta" (White Resistance—anti-fascist, not white supremacist). They developed tetrachromatic-responsive inks specifically to avoid detection by authorities.*

*The technique involves layering conventional inks with crystalline compounds that reflect only in specific wavelengths visible to tetrachromatic perception. Very sophisticated. Very expensive. Very rare.*

*If someone in California is using similar techniques, they either:*
*1. Obtained materials from European anti-fascist networks*
*2. Developed the chemistry independently (requiring advanced knowledge)*
*3. Have access to research-grade tetrachromatic studies*

*Given the shipping error that delivered this item to your friend's address, there may be connection. The original intended recipient, H.E. Lindqvist at Lund University, was researching tetrachromatic perception in art history.*

*Worth investigating if your friend's UV artist has any Scandinavian connections.*

"Scandinavian connections," Chloe says faintly.

"And look at the original shipping address," Maria points out. "H.E. Lindqvist. Lund University."

"Hale Erik Lindqvist. That's his full name. That's who the record was supposed to go to."

"Before the false accusations. Before he had to disappear."

"Before he became maintenance ghost painting invisible messages for tetrachromatic eyes."

The evidence crystallizes. The mis-shipped record. The sophisticated UV techniques. The spectrum analysis proving innocence. All leading to the same conclusion.

"He's alive," Chloe whispers. "He's here. He's been painting for me for twenty months."

"And now we can prove it," Dr. Tanaka says. "Scientifically. Definitively."

### Part 7: The Private Vindication

Chloe stares at the documentation spread across the lab bench. Spectrum analyses. Email chains. Photographic evidence. Chemical composition reports. Everything needed to clear his name.

"This is enough, isn't it?" she asks. "To prove he didn't vandalize anything? To show his UV work was completely separate?"

"More than enough," Dr. Tanaka confirms. "This would exonerate him completely. But—"

"But?"

"But only if we can connect him to these bathroom messages. We'd need to prove the same person painted both the messages you can see and the anti-fascist record sleeve."

"The handwriting—"

"Wouldn't hold up legally. But scientifically? If the paint formulations match the European anti-fascist techniques?"

"They would." Chloe touches the photos of his messages. "He learned their chemistry. Perfected it. Made it work for me specifically."

"Twenty months of research," Maria says quietly. "Twenty months of trying to reach you through frequencies only you can see."

"While being accused of crimes he didn't commit."

"While having evidence in his possession that proves his innocence."

Chloe looks at her friends—Maria who brought the evidence, Dr. Tanaka who analyzed it scientifically. Private vindication. Laboratory proof. Truth visible in frequencies beyond normal perception.

"What now?" she asks.

"Now," Maria says, "we find him. We give him this evidence. We help him reclaim his name."

"And then?"

"And then you two stop painting invisible messages on bathroom walls and start creating art the rest of us can actually see."

Chloe laughs—the sound has color, gold-relief with silver edges of possibility. For the first time in twenty months, the search has direction. The evidence has substance. The impossible has proof.

"Hitta mig där vattern började," she reads again from his message.

Find me where the water began.

"I know where that is," she says.

"Where?"

"The lagoon. Where the flood started. Where everything changed."

"When?"

"Tonight. At sunset. When the UV messages become visible for exactly four minutes."

The private truth is about to become public vindication.
The invisible is about to become undeniable.
The laboratory proof is about to meet the human heart.
