# When Emergency Lights Reveal
*January 9, 2023, 8:47 PM - Humanities Building, Second Floor*

## Part 1: The Death of Light

The lights die.

No flicker. No warning. No slow fade like in movies where people have time to gasp, to reach for each other, to prepare. Just sudden black so complete she tastes it—burnt copper and snow, the flavor of absolute darkness flooding her mouth like she's drowning in it.

"What the—" Someone's voice from down the hall. Male. Scared.

Then screaming. Not one voice but several, rising from the stairwell like smoke. And underneath the human sounds: water. Not the gentle lap of ocean on sand that she grew up with, not the musical trickle of fountains in the campus courtyards. This water sounds angry. Sounds hungry. Sounds like it's looking for something.

Looking for them.

Chloe's hands find the wall—cool plaster, slightly damp from the storm. She'd been walking toward the study room, following one of those UV trails she'd been seeing all week, the ones that shimmer at the edge of perception like heat mirages but in frequencies that taste purple. She'd finally decided to follow one to its source, staying late after her evening seminar, waiting for the building to empty so she could investigate without looking insane.

And now—

"Everyone stay calm!" A professor's voice from somewhere below. Professor Williams from the English department, she thinks. The one who always smells like pipe tobacco and disappointment. "Emergency lighting will—"

The emergency lighting kicks in.

But it's wrong. All wrong.

Not the usual harsh white fluorescents that make everyone look corpse-pale. These are different. UV-tinged. Battery-powered. Running on some backup system she's never seen activate before. The light comes in waves—purple-white-blue—cycling through wavelengths like a heartbeat.

And the world explodes.

## Part 2: The Invisible Gallery

The walls blaze with paint that shouldn't exist.

Not just one wall. Not just accents or touches. Every. Single. Surface.

Chloe's tetrachromatic eyes—the eyes that see a hundred million colors where others see three million—process the impossible gallery surrounding her. The UV paint reveals itself in layers, depths, dimensions that make her stomach flip with vertigo. It's like standing inside a living thing, inside someone's mind made visible.

Hooked letters crawl across the ceiling—Swedish, she thinks, those little crowns floating above vowels like halos on angels. But wrong. Twisted. Like someone wrote them underwater, or dying, or both. The words pulse with their own light, shifting between frequencies her brain translates into sensation:

*Jag målar för någon jag aldrig träffat*
(I paint for someone I've never met)

The midnight-blue floods her mouth with salt, the taste of tears she hasn't cried yet. Arctic-silver numbs her tongue like she's been eating ice, like she's been kissing winter. Poison-yellow—no, not poison, something else, something that makes her gag with its intensity—cadmium yellow-green at exactly 545 nanometers, her brain supplies, the frequency of nausea and ecstasy combined.

"What the hell—"

She stumbles backward, her hand searching for something solid, something real. Her spine hits the wall and—

It's wet.

Not water-wet. Paint-wet. Fresh.

She pulls her hand away and in the UV light she can see it: her palm glowing with transferred pigment, patterns that weren't there seconds ago now mapped across her skin like temporary tattoos, like promises, like proof.

The paint is still wet. Someone was here. Recently. Maybe minutes ago. Maybe—

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

---

## Part 3: The Ghost Becomes Real

In the doorway: a silhouette.

Tall—maybe six-two, her brain catalogues automatically, the way it categorizes colors and frequencies and the seventeen different temperatures she's been feeling all week in places he's touched. Narrow shoulders, long arms, hands that hang at his sides like they're not quite sure what to do when they're not holding a brush.

He's holding something that glows. A UV pen, she realizes. Still uncapped. Still dripping.

"You see them."

Not a question. That accent—Swedish, careful, like he's testing if words still work after months of silence. The consonants sharper than American English, the vowels rounder, fuller. The maintenance ghost. Real. Here. Standing in the doorway watching her see his invisible gallery with something like wonder, something like relief, something like recognition.

"The paintings," she manages, her voice cracking. "They're—everywhere. Every wall. How long—"

"Three years." He steps forward and the emergency light catches his face properly for the first time.

Sharp bones, like someone carved him from pale wood and forgot to sand down the edges. Eyes that reflect frequencies that shouldn't exist—green, but not just green. Forty-three different greens if she counts them all, which she does, automatically, the way she counts everything. Forest-green-217 at the centers fading to sea-foam-98 at the edges with rings of jade-silver-mercury where normal people would just see "hazel."

"Three years?" Her voice sounds strange, like it's coming from someone else. "You've been painting these for three years?"

"Started small. Just one wall in the basement. Testing if anyone would notice." He sets down the UV pen on the window ledge, his hand shaking slightly. She notices his fingers—long, stained with chemicals that glow faintly under the emergency lights. "No one did. So I painted more. And more. Until—"

"Until what?"

"Until October. When someone finally responded."

---

## Part 4: The Test

"How many colors?" His voice cracks on 'colors,' like it's a word he's been wanting to say to someone specific for a very long time.

She doesn't have to think about it. Her brain has already catalogued them, filed them away in the strange mental system she's developed over twenty years of seeing things others can't.

"In that spiral there?" She points to a pattern near the door. "Fifty-three distinct shades. No—fifty-four. They keep shifting. Like they're breathing."

His intake of breath is sharp, sudden. Like she's punched him. Like she's saved him.

"Most people see one. Maybe two if the light's right and they're really looking."

"I'm not most people."

"No," he agrees, and there's something in his voice that makes her skin prickle with recognition. "You're not. You have four types of color cones instead of three. You're tetrachromatic."

Four cones. The words hang in the air between them like UV paint, invisible to everyone but them.

"How do you know that?" Her voice is whisper-thin. "How could you possibly know that?"

"Because I researched it. After—" He stops, looks at the walls covered in months, years of work. "After I realized you were responding."

"Responding?"

He pulls out his phone, swipes to photos. "Look."

The first image: a pattern painted on the library basement wall. A spiral of colors that starts with pure UV white and shifts through spectrums she doesn't have names for.

The second image: a photograph someone posted on Instagram. Her Instagram. October 15th. Her pencils arranged on a study desk in the exact same spiral pattern, unconsciously echoing something she'd never consciously seen.

"That's—that's mine."

"I know." He swipes again. "And this."

November 3rd. A painting on the third-floor hallway—interlocking circles in seventeen different UV shades.

Next photo: Her coffee cups from the campus café, arranged and photographed, posted with the caption "when your brain won't stop making patterns." The same seventeen circles, the same mathematical relationships between them.

"I started painting responses," he says, swiping through more photos. Each UV painting followed by one of her unconscious arrangements. "You'd create a pattern, I'd see it and paint it in UV the next night. Then you'd respond to mine without knowing it. We've been having a conversation, Chloe."

Her name. He knows her name.

"How—"

"Instagram handle. @ChloeMartinezArt."

Of course.

A student runs past the doorway, flashlight swinging wildly. The beam illuminates the walls—

Nothing. Just beige paint. Institutional. Bland. Normal.

The student doesn't slow, doesn't gasp, doesn't see the miracle surrounding them.

But when the emergency light cycles back through its UV wavelength, the paintings blaze back to life.

Only for her.

"Does anyone else—can anyone else see—"

He shakes his head. "I've tested it. Brought other people here with UV lights. Showed them photos." He shows her his phone again, swipes to the camera app, holds it up to the wall.

Through the screen: blank beige walls.

Through her eyes: a gallery of impossible beauty.

"The cameras can't capture it," he says. "The frequency is too specific. And human eyes—normal human eyes—they don't have the receptors."

"Just me?"

"Just you." He pauses, and she can see him struggling with something, deciding whether to say it. "I painted them for you. Only for you. I didn't know who you were at first, but I knew you were seeing them. Responding. The only person who could."

---

## Part 5: The Recognition

The patterns. Oh god, the patterns.

Now that he's pointed it out, she can see it everywhere. That spiral in the corner—it matches her pencil arrangement from October, yes, but it's more than that. It's been evolving. Each time she created a new pattern, he responded with a variation. Each time he painted something new, she unconsciously echoed it in her daily life.

"That burst there—" She points to an explosion of gold-silver-pearl near the window.

"Your Instagram from November 20th. The way you arranged the leaves you collected."

"And that grid pattern—"

"December 1st. Your advent calendar but in frequencies only you could see."

She turns in a slow circle, taking it all in. Three years of work. Hundreds of paintings. Thousands of hours. All invisible to everyone but her.

"Why?" she asks. "Why spend three years painting things no one could see?"

"Because someone could see them. You could. I knew you were out there, somewhere. I could feel it. Like—" He struggles for words, his accent thickening. "In Sweden, we have stories about the Huldra. Forest spirits only certain people can perceive. They leave signs, patterns, trails of light. But only for the ones meant to see them."

"And you thought I was meant to see these?"

"I hoped. And then you proved it. Every pattern you made, every response—you were seeing them. We were talking without words, without meeting, without even knowing each other existed."

The building shudders.

Not earthquake. Something worse.

Water.

Through the window, she can see it. The lagoon has breached its banks. The water isn't just rising—it's racing, searching, hungry. Already at the building's entrance. Already inside.

"We need to go." His voice shifts from wonder to urgency. "Now."

## Part 6: The Touch

He grabs her hand.

The contact is electric but not—it's more than that, stranger than that. Seventeen different temperatures register simultaneously where his skin meets hers, her synesthesia exploding into combinations that shouldn't exist:

- Thumb: 98.7°F translating to amber-gold-honey
- Index finger: 97.9°F reading as coral-pink-dawn  
- Middle finger: 98.1°F processing as silver-blue-moon
- Ring finger: 96.8°F becoming forest-green-deep
- Pinkie: 97.2°F shifting to violet-purple-dusk
- Palm center: 99.1°F blazing orange-red-sun
- Wrist pulse: 98.6°F exact, pure white-light-center

And ten more points across his hand, each with its own temperature, its own color, its own frequency that her impossible brain translates into meaning.

Seventeen warms. 

She's felt them before—in library books he's touched, their pages carrying his heat signature for hours after. Bench arms where he's rested, the wood retaining his specific thermal pattern. Walls he's painted, the oils from his skin mixing with the UV pigments to create a signature only her tetrachromatic nervous system can detect.

"You're real," she says, stupid with recognition. All these weeks of feeling haunted, of sensing someone just out of sight, of following trails that led nowhere—he was real. Is real. Is here.

"So are you." His grip tightens, and three of the seventeen temperatures spike. "You're the ghost I've been painting for."

They start running.

---

## Part 7: The Revelation in Motion

The hallway stretches before them, lit by emergency strobes that cycle through UV wavelengths. With each flash, more paintings reveal themselves—not random, she realizes, but a mapped journey. He's been creating a path.

"Did you plan this?" she gasps as they run.

"Plan what?"

"The paintings—they're leading somewhere."

"To the tower. Always to the tower. Highest point on campus."

They pass a cluster of students heading the wrong way. "Not that way!" Hale shouts. "Water's coming from there!"

"How do you know?" someone yells back.

"I work maintenance. I know where the lowest points are. Follow us!"

Some do. Some don't.

They keep running, and with each section of hallway, Chloe reads more of their unconscious conversation painted on the walls:

*October 15:* His first response to her pattern—tentative, questioning.  
*October 22:* Her unconscious reply—more complex, adding elements.  
*October 29:* His excitement visible in the paint strokes—larger, bolder.  
*November 5:* Her patterns becoming deliberate, even if she didn't know why.  
*November 12:* His confession in Swedish: *Jag tror jag älskar någon jag aldrig träffat* (I think I love someone I've never met).  
*November 19:* Her response in pure pattern—a heart shape she doesn't remember making.

"The walls," she breathes, not from exertion but from understanding. "They're a diary. Our diary."

"Three years of one-sided conversation," he says, pulling her around a corner. "Until two months ago when you started answering."

They pass more students fleeing. 

"The walls!" Chloe shouts, needing someone else to see, to witness, to confirm she's not losing her mind. "Look at the walls!"

No one looks. Or they look and see nothing. Their eyes slide past miracles, focused only on escape. One girl even runs her hand along the wall for balance, her palm passing right through a UV masterpiece, and feels nothing but institutional beige.

She's alone in this vision.

No—

"I painted them for you," Hale says, pulling her up the stairwell. The UV paintings here are different—more urgent, more recent. Some still wet like the one she touched. "Only for you. I didn't know who you were, but I knew you were seeing them. Responding. The only person who could."

---

## Part 8: The Science of Seeing

As they climb, he explains in breathless bursts:

"Tetrachromacy—genetic mutation—X-chromosome linked—"

"My mother," Chloe gasps, understanding flooding through her. "She used to say she saw colors that didn't exist. They medicated her for it."

"Not madness—evolution—fourth cone—between red and green—hundred million colors—"

"Instead of three million—I know—I counted them once—took me a week—"

They reach the third floor. Water sounds below. Closer. Angrier.

"How did you know to paint in UV?"

"I didn't—at first—just liked how it looked—under blacklight in my room—then I researched—found papers—about tetrachromats—some can see into UV spectrum—"

"Dr. Jameson's paper—Newcastle University—I read it too—"

"You researched yourself?"

"Wouldn't you?" She laughs, but it's edged with hysteria. "If you saw impossible things?"

Fourth floor. The paintings here are all from this week. Fresh. Desperate. Like he knew something was coming.

"This week's paintings," she pants. "They're different."

"I knew—felt it—something changing—had to paint faster—more—"

"The storm—"

"Not just the storm—you were coming closer—following the trails—I could feel it—"

Fifth floor. Almost there.

"Wait." She stops, has to know. "My patterns—could you always see them?"

"No." He turns to face her, and in the strobing UV light, his eyes cycle through all forty-three greens. "But I felt them. Like pressure changes. Like someone calling my name in a frequency I couldn't quite hear. So I painted toward the feeling."

"And I arranged toward yours."

"We were finding each other." His accent is thick now, emotion and exertion stripping away his careful English. "Through impossible colors. Through invisible art."

The building shakes. Water has reached the second floor.

"Come on!"

## Part 9: The Cathedral of Light

They burst through the door to the final stairwell, the one that leads to the tower room, and Chloe stops so suddenly that the students behind them crash into her back.

"Holy—"

It's a cathedral.

No—it's more than that.

Every surface—walls, ceiling, pipes, handrails, even the underside of the stairs above them—is covered in UV paintings. But these aren't like the ones below. These are synchronized. Orchestrated. They tell a story.

"When did you—"

"Every night for three years. This was my real canvas. The other halls were just... breadcrumbs. Leading here."

She turns in a slow circle, reading the story in light:

Panel 1: A figure alone, painting in darkness.  
Panel 2: Shadows watching, always just out of sight.  
Panel 3: Patterns appearing—small at first, then growing.  
Panel 4: Two sets of patterns, dancing around each other.  
Panel 5: Recognition—two figures finally seeing each other.  
Panel 6: Water rising, but the figures are together.

"You painted our future," she whispers.

"I painted my hope."

The water crashes below. Third floor now. Rising faster.

"There!" He points to a door marked "Authorized Personnel Only." His maintenance keys shake as he unlocks it. "Carillon room. Highest point."

As they climb the final narrow staircase, Chloe turns for one last look at the cathedral of invisible art. Every surface is covered in frequencies only she can see, their unconscious conversation made manifest in UV and wonder.

But more than that—she can see the evolution. The paintings from three years ago are tentative, questioning. The ones from last year are bolder, more confident. And the ones from the last two months—since she started responding—they're explosions of joy, of recognition, of connection.

They're love letters in light.

---

## Part 10: The Promise

"After this," she says as he opens the door to the tower room. The space is small, cramped, filled with the mechanical workings of the carillon bells. But it's dry. High. Safe for now. "After we don't die. Will I still see them?"

He turns to her, and she can see he's been crying. The tears leave trails in the UV paint dust on his face, creating new patterns, new art.

"Only if you know where to look." He pulls something from his pocket—a small UV flashlight, the kind used for checking counterfeit bills, but modified somehow, the wavelength adjusted to exactly 365 nanometers. "Or if you have this."

She takes it. Their fingers touch again—seventeen warms, always seventeen, her personal proof that he's real—and her synesthesia translates his touch into colors that taste like safety in a drowning world:

- Safety tastes like amber-gold-honey
- Trust tastes like coral-pink-dawn
- Recognition tastes like silver-blue-moon
- Desire tastes like forest-green-deep
- Fear tastes like violet-purple-dusk
- Love tastes like orange-red-sun
- And hope—hope tastes like pure white-light-center

"What's your name?" she realizes she doesn't know. "Your real name?"

"Hale. Hale Lindqvist."

"Hale," she repeats, and his name tastes like winter mornings, like UV light, like art that only exists for her. "I'm Chloe Martinez."

"I know," he says, and smiles for the first time. "I've been painting your name on walls for two months."

They can hear others reaching the door—other students who followed them, who trusted the maintenance ghost and the girl who sees impossible colors. They'll squeeze maybe fifteen people into this tiny room. They'll spend eight hours pressed close, sharing air, sharing warmth, sharing the knowledge that they might die.

But right now, in this moment before the others arrive, it's just them.

"Show me," Chloe says, clicking on the UV flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness, and yes—there on the wall, painted in pigments that shouldn't exist:

*Chloe Martinez kan se mig*  
(Chloe Martinez can see me)

*Jag målar för Chloe Martinez*  
(I paint for Chloe Martinez)

*Chloe Martinez, du är inte ensam*  
(Chloe Martinez, you are not alone)

Her name, over and over, in frequencies only she can perceive. A prayer. A promise. A proof that someone else knows what it's like to see the world differently.

"I see you," she says.

"And I see you seeing," he replies.

The door bursts open. Students flood in. The room fills with bodies, with panic, with the sounds of rising water.

But Chloe and Hale stand by the small window, watching the flood transform their campus into an ocean, and she thinks: 

*We've already been drowning. In isolation. In impossible perception. In colors without names.*

*Maybe this flood isn't ending something.*

*Maybe it's beginning.*

She clicks off the UV light to save the battery. They'll need it later, during the eight hours of darkness ahead, to read the rest of their conversation painted on these walls. To understand how two strangers fell in love through invisible art. To prove that connection doesn't require meeting—sometimes it just requires seeing and being seen.

The water rises.

The conversation continues.

And somewhere in the darkness, new patterns begin to form—not in paint this time, but in the space between two people who speak in frequencies the rest of the world will never understand.
