# Following Invisible Trails
*September 18, 2024 - Morning Before Coffee Meeting*

---

## Part 1: The Basement Hum

The library basement hums at a frequency that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like secrets.

No one else hears it—she's watched seventeen people walk past without reacting. Students carrying normal problems. Librarians with normal vision. That other maintenance worker who moves through the same spaces but leaves no invisible traces, no frequencies that speak to her broken perception. They don't pause, don't tilt their heads, don't feel the vibration that turns her teeth into tuning forks.

But to her, the sound has color—pearl-violet with edges that shift green when she moves closer to the wall where yesterday she found him. Where twenty months ago water reached. Where now fresh UV paint blazes in frequencies that shouldn't exist.

"Still down here?"

Maria descends the stairs, coffee in each hand. One for her, one for Chloe—she knows the routine.

"He was here again," Chloe says.

"When?"

"This morning. Maybe an hour ago. The paint's still wet."

Maria squints at the wall. "I don't see—"

"You wouldn't. It's in—" She stops. Almost said *UV spectrum*. "It's in a frequency you can't see."

"Right. Your special vision thing." Maria doesn't say it mockingly. She's trying to understand. Has been trying for months. "What does it say?"

Chloe traces the invisible letters with her finger, translating: "*Följ färgerna till sanningen.*"

"Which means?"

"Follow the colors to the truth."

"Dramatic. Very Swedish art boy."

"It's not drama. It's—" How to explain? "He's leaving me a trail. To understand what we've been doing. The unconscious conversation."

"You mean your weird arranging thing and his invisible paintings?"

"They're not weird. They're—"

"I know, I know. Your special frequency language. But Chloe—" Maria sits on the bottom step, coffee cup balanced on her knee. "You're meeting him for coffee in three hours. Why the cryptic treasure hunt first?"

"Because seeing is understanding. He wants me to see it all. Every painting. Every response. Twenty months of—"

"Of what?"

"Connection."

Maria studies her. That worried-friend look she's perfected.

"You don't really know him."

"I know his frequency. I know how his mind works in color. I know what makes him paint at 3 AM and why he chooses this wall, this angle, this exact shade of invisible."

"That's not the same as knowing someone."

"Isn't it?" Chloe photographs the wall—through her phone screen, blank concrete; through her eyes, a love letter. "When someone creates in exact patterns you create, when they respond to things you don't even know you're broadcasting, when your unconscious minds have been having conversations for twenty months—what do you call that?"

"It's something. I'm not sure it's knowing."

"Then what is it?"

"Maybe beautiful delusion. Maybe your brains got scrambled in that tower and now you're both seeing patterns that aren't there. Maybe—"

"Maybe real."

"Yeah. Maybe that too."

---

## Part 2: The News Article

They sit on the basement floor, Chloe searching her phone while Maria pretends not to hover.

"What are you looking for?"

"Context. There's something—" She finds it. News article from last year. "Here. 'Gallery Owner's Son Cleared in Vandalism Case.'"

"So?"

"James Holbrook. Accused someone of stealing his UV painting technique."

"Wait, UV painting is an actual thing? Like, people do this professionally?"

"Apparently. But look—" She scrolls. "The accused was a Swedish exchange student. Maintenance worker. Name withheld."

"You think it was Hale?"

"Timeline fits. Says the accused had been painting 'invisible murals' on campus. That security couldn't find evidence because—"

"Because they're invisible."

"To most people."

Maria reads over her shoulder. "Says Holbrook claimed the other artist stole his technique, his style, his concept. But couldn't prove it because—"

"Because he couldn't see the actual paintings. Just knew someone else was doing UV work."

"This is insane."

"This is why Hale hides. Why he paints invisible. Someone tried to destroy him for creating art most people can't even see."

Her phone buzzes. Text from unknown number. Just coordinates: 34.413°N, 119.848°W.

"That's—" Maria starts.

"Humanities building. Third floor."

"How do you know the floor?"

"The third number. 848. Building number is 848. He's been teaching me his code."

"When?"

"Every painting. Every pattern. I just didn't know I was learning."

She photographs another UV message with her phone, knowing the camera won't capture what she sees. But sometimes, in the metadata, in the exif data, fragments remain. Traces of the invisible conversation.

Her phone buzzes. A Google alert she set up months ago: *New mention of "Hale Lindqvist" + "UCSB"*

A cached forum post. Campus gossip from January 2023. Someone called "GKeane_MBA" discussing "maintenance worker with extremist connections." The thread is mostly deleted now, but pieces survive in search engine archives.

How did it start? How does someone's name become synonymous with danger?

She scrolls through the digital archaeology, following the trail backward to its source...

## Part 3: Digital Archaeology

*[January 10, 2023 - The Day After the Car Park]*

Gavin Keane understands research. MBA program teaches you to find leverage, identify weakness, build cases. And the Toyota Corolla with license plate 8VXH291 just gave him a case study in accountability.

DMV lookup app: $4.99 well spent. Vehicle registered to Hale Erik Lindqvist, 1247 Carrillo Street, Apartment 3B. Swedish name. Interesting.

Google search: "Hale Lindqvist" + "Santa Barbara"

First result makes his coffee go cold.

*"UCSB Maintenance Worker Arrested in Extremist Art Investigation"*
*The Independent, March 15, 2022*

Screenshot. Save. Screenshot the URL. Screenshot the archived version. 

*"Authorities investigated reports of extremist messaging hidden in campus murals..."*

*"Suspect, identified as Hale E. Lindqvist (27), was found in possession of materials linked to Norwegian black metal groups with known fascist connections..."*

*"Charges later dropped due to insufficient evidence..."*

But the internet remembers everything.

More searching:
- "Norwegian black metal extremism"  
- "Permafrost band fascist"
- "UCSB campus vandalism 2022"
- "Invisible murals UV paint terrorism"

Each search adds to his arsenal. Screenshots multiplying in his camera roll like evidence cards.

Discord first. The campus events crew chat:

**GKeane_MBA**: *Anyone else know about this? Maintenance guy who hit my bike yesterday has arrest record for extremist art. Check this out* [image]

**BrodieMktg**: *Wait what*

**GKeane_MBA**: *Literally hit and run yesterday, looked him up, dude was investigated for hiding fascist messages in UV paint around campus*

**ChloeEvents**: *That's the invisible art guy? I heard about that*

**GKeane_MBA**: *"Invisible art" = dogwhistle for hidden extremism. They couldn't prove it but like... where there's smoke*

**BrodieMktg**: *Why is he still working here if he was arrested?*

**GKeane_MBA**: *Charges dropped doesn't mean innocent. Means they couldn't prove it YET*

Within an hour, the screenshots have jumped chats. Campus WhatsApp groups. Instagram stories. Each retelling compresses nuance, amplifies danger:

"Maintenance worker with extremist connections"
"Norwegian fascist music collection"  
"Hidden messages in UV paint"
"Still working on campus"
"Hit my friend's bike and fled"

By evening: "Extremist maintenance worker fled hit-and-run scene" 

The algorithm learns. Suggests related content. Norwegian black metal documentaries. "Signs of Radicalization on College Campuses." "When Coworkers Hide Dark Secrets."

Gavin screenshots everything. Creates folder on his phone: "Evidence - H.Lindqvist Incident." Professional approach. MBA thinking.

He posts to his LinkedIn:
*"Interesting case study in background checks and workplace safety. How well do we really know the people who have access to our spaces? #CampusSafety #DueDiligence #RiskManagement"*

No names mentioned. Just enough to seem thoughtful, concerned.

The likes accumulate. Comments from other MBA students, professional networkers, anyone who enjoys feeling informed about hidden dangers.

**Jennifer_HR_MBA**: *This is why proper vetting matters*

**MikeMgmtConsult**: *Most institutions skip this step*

**GKeane_MBA**: *Exactly. Public safety should be transparent*

He crafts the perfect response - professional concern mixed with just enough detail to seem credible without being legally actionable.

Three days later, the screenshots have fossilized into fact. "Remember that extremist maintenance worker? The one who did hit-and-run?" 

Truth becomes telephone game becomes weaponized gossip becomes digital permanent record.

Gavin feels satisfied. Not malicious - he tells himself he's performing a public service. Accountability. Transparency. Due diligence.

He never considers that "charges dropped" might mean "completely innocent."

He never wonders what it feels like to have your name googled and find extremism accusations.

He never thinks about the difference between research and character assassination.

Just organizes the screenshots into better folders, updates his LinkedIn to reflect his "commitment to campus safety advocacy," and moves on to other projects.

The damage spreads through fiber optic cables at light speed.

By week's end, a facilities supervisor mentions "concerns about the Lindqvist situation" in a staff meeting. Security gets copied on new maintenance assignments. Hale's access to certain buildings gets quietly reviewed.

None of it official. None of it documented. Just ambient suspicion settling like dust.

But that's January 2023.

## Part 4: The Storage Room Gallery

*[September 18, 2024 - Present Day]*

The humanities building should be busy—morning classes, students everywhere. But the trail leads through maintenance corridors, unused stairwells, spaces between spaces where no one goes.

"This is creepy," Maria says, following.

"It's practical. He can't be seen. The Holbrook thing—"

"Was dropped. Says so in the article."

"Dropped doesn't mean forgotten. Dropped doesn't mean safe."

They reach a door marked "Storage." In UV spectrum, it blazes with text:

*För dig som ser*

"What's it say?" Maria asks.

"For you who sees."

"Just you? Or anyone who—"

"Just me. It's singular. Specific."

Chloe's hand trembles on the doorknob. Not fear. Recognition. The paint is still wet in UV spectrum—he was here recently. Maybe minutes ago. The seventeen different temperatures of his handprint still warm on the handle.

She opens the door.

"Holy shit," Maria breathes.

Even she can see something. Not the UV paintings—those blaze only for Chloe. But the sheer scale. Every surface covered. Three years of work.

"It's a gallery," Chloe whispers.

"It's an obsession."

"It's—" She steps inside, turns slowly. "It's responses. All of it. Responses to me."

"What?"

She points to the east wall. "October 2023. I arranged leaves by the campus fountain. Posted it on Instagram. This is the same pattern, but in UV."

"Coincidence."

"December 2023." She points to another section. "I sorted books by color frequency in the library. This is that exact gradient."

"How can you remember—"

"February 2024. I had an anxiety attack. Arranged sugar packets in the coffee shop to calm down. This—" She touches a painting that screams even in UV, chaos given color. "This is my panic translated to paint."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible."

Maria walks the perimeter, trying to see what Chloe sees. "There must be hundreds of paintings here."

"Four hundred ninety-seven."

"You counted?"

"Always counting. But also—" She points to tiny numbers in the corner of each piece. "He numbered them. Dated them. Creating a record."

"Of what?"

"Of unconscious conversation. Look—" She pulls out her phone, scrolls through her Instagram. "Every arrangement I posted has a painted response. Every pattern I created, he answered. We've been talking for twenty months without knowing."

"That's—"

"Insane? Beautiful? Impossible?"

"I was going to say romantic, but also terrifying."

"Why terrifying?"

"Because it means he's been watching you. Following your posts. Painting responses. For twenty months. Without you knowing."

"Without him knowing I could see them."

"What?"

"Think about it. He painted these before yesterday. Before we reunited. He was painting into the void, hoping someone, somewhere could see. Not knowing I existed."

"But targeting you specifically."

"No. Responding to patterns that appeared in places he could access. I was arranging things unconsciously. He was responding unconsciously. Neither of us knew the other existed but we were—"

"Having a conversation."

"Yes."

---

## Part 4: The Discovery

"Oh shit, someone's coming."

Footsteps in the hallway. Maria panics, but Chloe recognizes the rhythm—not Hale. Too heavy. Too careless.

The door opens. Marcus stands there, board shorts despite September, vape pen in hand.

"Martinez? What are you doing in my smoke spot?"

"Your what?"

"Found this place weeks ago. Perfect for—" He waves the vape pen. Then pauses. Looks around. "Wait, did someone clean it? It looks... different."

Chloe sees blazing gallery. Marcus sees empty room.

"Different how?" she asks carefully.

"I don't know. Cleaner? Emptier? Like someone painted over all the graffiti."

"There was graffiti?"

"Yeah, tons. Kids been tagging this place for years. But now—" He runs his hand along a wall covered in UV masterpieces. "Nothing. Weird."

He can't see any of it. The UV paint invisible to his normal eyes.

"Probably maintenance," Maria says quickly. "You know, cleaning up forgotten spaces."

"Since when does maintenance care about—" His phone buzzes. "Shit, late for philosophy. Don't narc about the vape, yeah?"

He leaves. They exhale simultaneously.

"He couldn't see any of it," Maria says.

"No one can. Except—"

"You."

"And partially Hale. He has some UV perception. Not complete, but enough."

"How do you know?"

"The paintings. Some parts are more detailed than others. The parts he can see fully versus the parts he's painting blind, on faith."

"Painting on faith." Maria shakes her head. "This whole thing is—"

"Look at this."

Fresh painting on the north wall. Still wet. Chloe can see the heat signature of his hands in the paint—seventeen different temperatures swirling through the pigment.

"What is it?"

"Me. Yesterday. The pencil arrangement I made while waiting."

"He saw you?"

"He was there. Watching me discover the library. Watching me understand. Then came here and painted it immediately."

Under the painting, Swedish and English intertwined:

*Kaffe klockan tre?*
*Coffee at three?*

"He's confirming your meeting."

"More than that. He's—" She checks the heat signatures around the room. "He's been here all morning. Setting this up. Creating context for our meeting. He wants me to understand what we've been doing before we talk about it."

"That's either really romantic or really manipulative."

"It's neither. It's—necessary. How else do you explain twenty months of unconscious communication? You have to see it to believe it."

---

## Part 5: The Trail Continues

"There's more."

Chloe follows the heat signatures—a trail of seventeen warms leading out of the room, down the hall, to another door.

"How are you tracking him?"

"Body heat lingers in UV spectrum. Different temperatures for different times. He was here—" She touches a doorframe. "Fifteen minutes ago."

"He's still in the building?"

"Maybe. Or maybe he's leading me somewhere."

The trail goes up. Fourth floor. Fifth. To a door marked "Roof Access - Authorized Personnel Only."

It's unlocked.

"We shouldn't—" Maria starts.

But Chloe's already climbing. The door opens onto the roof. Santa Barbara spread below, ocean gleaming, mountains behind. And on the ledge—

More UV paintings. But these are different. Equations. Formulas. Chemical compositions.

"What is all this?"

"Instructions," Chloe realizes. "He's teaching me how to make UV paint. The exact frequencies he uses. So I can—"

"Paint back?"

"Respond consciously instead of unconsciously."

Her phone buzzes. Unknown number. Photo attachment.

It's her. Taken from above. Right now. She looks up.

Across the quad, on the library roof, a figure. Too far to see details but she knows it's him. He holds something up—UV flashlight. Aims it at the humanities building.

The entire wall below them explodes with light. UV messages visible even from here, covering the whole side of the building. And in the center, huge, impossible to miss:

*I SEE YOU SEEING ME*

Then he's gone. But the message remains, blazing in frequencies only she can perceive.

---

## Part 6: The Coffee Shop Preparation

2:17 PM. The coffee shop on State Street.

"I can't believe we're forty-three minutes early," Maria says.

"I need to see what he's done."

"What do you mean?"

"The barista at the counter. Yesterday she mentioned he'd been here painting. Invisible painting."

They enter. The shop smells wrong—flood-changed—but familiar. The barista looks up, recognizes Chloe.

"You're early. Your boyfriend's not here yet."

"He's not my—When was he here?"

"All morning. Noon to like two. Sitting in that corner, doing his weird hand-waving thing."

"Hand-waving?"

"Yeah, like painting but with nothing there. We almost called someone but he kept buying tea and he seemed harmless. Just... intense."

"Did he say anything?"

"Asked about the light. How it changes through the day. When the sun hits that window at exactly thirty-seven degrees. Super specific. Is he like, autistic or something?"

"Or something," Chloe says.

She walks to the corner table. Sits. Surveys his invisible work.

The entire coffee shop is transformed. UV messages on every surface:

On the bathroom mirror: *Twenty months of searching*
Under the table: *Seventeen warms remembered*  
On the window: *Du ser mig / You see me*
On the ceiling: *För Chloe som ser det omöjliga* (For Chloe who sees the impossible)

"What do you see?" Maria asks.

"Evidence. Proof. He's documented everything. Every response to my patterns. Every unconscious communication. It's all here, invisible to everyone but me."

"Why?"

"Because—" She understands suddenly. "Because I need to know it's real. That I haven't imagined it. That twenty months of feeling connected to something invisible was actually connection."

"You thought you imagined it?"

"My therapist said I was creating patterns to cope with trauma. That the arrangements were symptoms. That seeing responses that weren't there was—"

"Delusion."

"Yeah."

"But it's not."

"No. It's real. He's real. This impossible thing between us is real."

---

## Part 7: The Final Message

2:43 PM. Seventeen minutes before their meeting.

"I should go," Maria says. "Give you space for your reunion or whatever this is."

"Stay. Please. I need—I need someone else to witness this. To know I'm not—"

"Crazy?"

"Alone."

Maria squeezes her hand. "You're not alone. Even if I can't see what you see."

Chloe's phone buzzes. Text: "Look up."

She does.

Across the street, on the building roof, Hale stands. Visible for exactly three seconds. He holds up a UV light—industrial strength, the kind that makes invisible things blaze.

He aims it at the coffee shop window.

The glass explodes with color. Not just messages—art. A portrait of her made from twenty months of patterns she created, transformed into impossible beauty only she can see.

Then he's gone. But the portrait remains.

"What happened?" Maria asks. "You're crying."

"Am I?"

She touches her face. Wet. She's crying from beauty, from recognition, from the overwhelming relief of being seen.

"He painted me. Not how I look but how I exist. My frequency. My pattern. The thing that makes me me in spectrums others can't perceive."

"That's—"

"Impossible. I know."

"I was going to say beautiful."

---

## Part 8: The Understanding

2:55 PM. Five minutes before the meeting.

Chloe sits at their table. The one he marked with UV paint. The one where seventeen warms will soon radiate from across the table.

"You okay?" Maria asks.

"I understand now. The trail. Why he led me through all of this before meeting."

"Why?"

"Because how do you explain twenty months of unconscious communication? How do you sit across from someone and say 'we've been talking without knowing'? You can't. You have to show it."

"And he showed you."

"Every painting. Every response. Every moment of connection we didn't know we were having."

"That's incredibly thoughtful or incredibly obsessive."

"Both. It's both. That's what we are—thoughtfully obsessive about frequencies others can't see."

Maria's phone buzzes. "Shit, I have class. Will you be okay?"

"Yes."

"Text me after. I want to know everything."

"You won't believe everything."

"Try me. I've gotten pretty good at believing impossible things since you came into my life."

She hugs Chloe, then leaves.

2:59 PM.

Chloe arranges seventeen sugar packets on the table. Not consciously. Her hands just know. They form a pattern that responds to all the UV paintings surrounding her. An answer to his invisible gallery. A confirmation that she sees, she understands, she's ready for whatever comes next.

3:00 PM.

The door opens.

He enters.

The seventeen warms arrive with him, radiating heat she can map without trying. He's painted new messages on his skin—she can see them through his clothes. Words in Swedish and English and something beyond language.

He sees the sugar packet arrangement. Smiles—the expression creates new colors in her peripheral vision.

"You followed the trail."

"You knew I would."

"Hoped. Not knew."

"The difference?"

"Hope requires faith. Knowing requires evidence."

"And now?"

"Now I have both."

He sits across from her. Exactly where his UV painting indicated. The seventeen warms settle into pattern she'll map forever—the specific heat signature of someone who creates in her frequencies.

"Hi," he says.

"Hi," she responds.

The conversation that's been unconscious for twenty months becomes conscious. The connection that's been invisible becomes visible. At least to them. At least for now.

That's enough.

That's everything.
