# Water Rising
*January 9, 2023, 9:47 PM - Storke Tower, Carillon Room*

---

## Arrival: The Last High Ground

Water sounds different when it's hunting you.

Not the gentle lap of ocean on sand that Chloe grew up with in Santa Barbara, not the musical trickle of the campus fountains where students make wishes. This water growls—deep frequency that her synesthesia translates into the color of endings: black-brown-silver with edges that taste like rust and regret.

They burst through the door of the carillon room—fifteen students total, all following the maintenance ghost and the girl who sees impossible things. The space is smaller than Chloe expected. Maybe twelve by twelve feet, cramped with the mechanical workings of the bells that mark campus hours. Cables and pulleys create a maze overhead. A single window on each wall. One door. No other exit.

"Jesus Christ, we're trapped," someone says—Brad from her discussion section, she thinks. His panic tastes purple-metallic in her mouth.

"We're alive," Hale counters, already at the east window, assessing. His accent thicker when stressed—Swedish consonants sharpening like ice, articles dropping. "Water at third step now. Five steps total."

Third step of the tower stairs. Five steps total before water reaches their level. Before the only room higher than flood becomes another kind of coffin.

The emergency lights here are different than in the main building—older, stranger. They cycle through wavelengths that make her tetrachromatic eyes scream with beauty and recognition. Every surface blazes with his hidden paintings—not just months but years of invisible messages suddenly visible, a gallery of devotion no one else could see.

"Holy shit," Emma breathes, spinning in a circle. "The walls—do you see—?"

"Power surge," Marcus says quickly. "Making weird shadows."

"That's not shadows," Emma insists. "There's paint—"

"Stress hallucinations," Brad cuts in. "Common in disasters. Just don't look at the walls."

But her eyes betray her, finding every message, every desperate stroke of hope made visible.

This room pulses with intention. Not random expression but organized devotion. Dated. Documented. A diary written in frequencies that didn't exist until someone needed to scream into the void and chose light as language:

*September 2020: First day. No one sees.*  
*October 2020: Still alone.*  
*November 2020: Painted seventeen birds. Erased sixteen.*  
*December 2020: Someone moved the brushes I left. Hope?*  
*January 2021: False alarm. Janitor.*

Three years of isolation mapped in light only she can perceive.

## Hour One: Establishing Territory

"How long do we have?" A girl Chloe doesn't recognize, crying quietly.

Hale turns from the window. In UV light, his skin looks transparent—she can see veins like rivers, pulse points throbbing purple-blue, the specific geography of his fear mapped across his body like a second skeleton.

"Two hours. Maybe three if rising slows."

"We should try the roof—" Marcus starts.

"Padlocked. Already checked." Hale's checking windows now, methodical. "Sealed. Plexiglass. Would need tools we don't have."

"Our phones—"

"I have signal," the crying girl says. "Should I call—?"

"Everyone call," Marcus takes charge. "Different carriers, different towers. Someone will get through."

The room fills with the sound of dialing, busy signals, recorded messages about high call volume. Chloe watches Hale work—checking windows, testing the door lock, examining the bell mechanism for anything useful. His movements create heat trails in her vision, seventeen different temperatures that linger in the air like ghost doubles.

"I'm getting through!" Brad shouts. "911, yes, we're trapped in Storke Tower. The carillon room. Top floor. Fifteen people. Water rising."

Everyone falls silent, listening to his half of the conversation.

"No, we can't get to the roof. Yes, we tried. How long until—what do you mean you don't know? We have maybe two hours before—hello? Hello?"

He lowers the phone. "They said they know our location. Helicopters when they can. Storm's grounding everything right now."

"When they can?" Emma's voice cracks. "That's it?"

"That's it."

Fear reshapes the room into familiar territories. Friends clutch friends. Strangers adopt each other. Couples curl inward like quotation marks around shared terror. And she—she gravitates toward the north wall where the UV messages scream silent truth. Ten feet from Hale but distance means nothing when you're reading someone's three-year conversation with darkness. Ten feet might be ten miles might be touching might be the exact distance needed for recognition to bloom.

Their eyes meet across the human topology of panic.

"Everyone stay calm," Marcus announces, though his voice shakes. "We're in the highest point on campus. The water will stop before it reaches us."

"How do you know?" Emma asks.

"Physics," Marcus lies with the confidence of someone who's never calculated death. "Water finds its level."

But the truth bleeds through in UV behind his head—Hale's careful mathematics painted on nights when sleep wouldn't come: *Tower height: 175 feet. Hundred-year flood line: 180 feet. We are five feet from drowning.*

---

## Hour Two: Recognition in Crisis

People settle into waiting. Some cry quietly. Some tell jokes that fall flat. Brad finds a deck of cards in his backpack, starts a game no one really plays. Emma and her roommate share earbuds, music tinny in the frightened quiet.

Chloe stays by her wall, reading three years of Hale's isolation painted in frequencies only she can see. She's so absorbed she doesn't notice him approach until his heat signature enters her peripheral vision—seventeen distinct temperatures announcing him like fanfare.

"You're reading them," he says quietly, standing close enough that others might not hear.

"Every word."

"Three years of talking to no one."

"Not no one. You were talking to someone who didn't exist yet."

He looks at her sharply. "What do you mean?"

"I mean—" She traces a pattern on the wall, careful not to actually touch the wet paint. "October 2021. You painted 'I feel someone watching.' That was the day I started at UCSB. Transfer student. First time on campus."

His breath catches—she hears it as color, blue-white like frozen oxygen.

"November 2021," she continues. "You wrote 'The patterns are changing.' That's when I started leaving my arrangements around campus. Unconscious at first."

"December 2021—"

"'Someone's responding,'" he finishes. "Started noticing pencils arranged like my paintings. Thought I was going insane."

"January 2022: 'Not insane. Someone sees.'"

"February 2022: 'Painted her name but don't know it.'"

"March 2022: 'Call her Ghost Girl.'"

They're reading together now, their voices creating harmony that tastes gold-silver in her synesthetic perception.

"April 2022: 'Ghost Girl made a spiral. Matched my dream.'"

"May 2022: 'We're having a conversation.'"

"June 2022: 'I think I—'" Hale stops. The rest of the sentence is painted over, obscured.

"You think you what?"

"Doesn't matter."

"It's painted on the wall. In UV. For me to see."

"Not everything is for—" He stops again. Looks at her. Really looks. "Actually, yes. Everything here is for you. I just didn't know it was you specifically."

Water hits the first step below them. The sound changes—less approach, more arrival.

"One hour, maybe hour and half now," Hale announces to the room.

Several people start crying harder.

---

## Hour Three: Failed Rescue Attempt

"Signal's back!" The crying girl—Jennifer, Chloe's learned—waves her phone. "I'm calling my parents."

"No," Marcus says. "Call 911 again. Parents can't help."

"Fuck you, I'm calling my mom."

And she does. The conversation breaks everyone:

"Mom? Mom, I'm trapped. The flood. Storke Tower. I don't know when—I don't know if—tell Dad I love him. Tell Jeremy—"

Others start calling. The room fills with goodbyes disguised as check-ins, love disguised as logistics.

Hale's phone rings. He looks at the screen, surprised.

"Yes? We're in Storke Tower. Carillon room. Fifteen people." He listens, then speaks rapidly in Swedish. Then back to English: "Water at first step below our level. Rising approximately one foot every twenty minutes."

He holds the phone out. "They want to talk to someone else. Verify our location."

Chloe takes it without thinking.

"Hello?"

"Ma'am, we're coordinating rescue efforts. Can you describe your exact position?"

"Carillon room, top of Storke Tower. Fifteen people. Water at—" she looks at Hale, who checks the window.

"Fourth step now."

"Fourth step below us. The room is—" She looks around, and her tetrachromatic vision explodes with information only she can process. "The room is covered in UV paint. Invisible unless you have blacklight equipment. If you're sending helicopters, you could use UV spots to identify—"

"Ma'am, I need you to stay calm. Hallucinations are common in crisis situations."

"It's not hallucination. The paint is real. UV spectrum, 365 nanometers. The whole tower is covered in—"

"Ma'am, we're doing everything we can. Do you have any visible signals? Flares? Flashlights?"

"The UV paint IS visible. If you have the right equipment—"

"We need standard visible signals. Can someone else—"

She hangs up.

"They think I'm crazy."

"You're not crazy," Hale says immediately. "You see what exists."

"But if they can't see it—"

"Then we make our own signal."

He pulls out his UV pen—the one he was holding when the lights first died. Walks to the east window, the one facing the coast where rescue would come from. Starts writing backwards so it reads correctly from outside:

**HJÄLP = HELP**  
**15 MÄNNISKOR = 15 PEOPLE**  
**VATTEN STIGER = WATER RISING**

But he's not just writing—he's creating art. The letters overlap, interweave, form patterns that make her synesthesia explode. The Swedish and English blend into something universal, desperate, beautiful.

"They still won't see—" Brad starts.

"She sees it," Hale says simply. "That's enough."

"Enough for what?" Brad demands. "Enough to die knowing someone saw your art?"

"Yes," Hale and Chloe say simultaneously.

The room goes quiet.

---

## Hour Four: Trading Truths

Water enters their room. Just dampness at the doorway edge, but promise of more. Everyone moves to the center, clusters tightening. Chloe and Hale end up pressed against the north wall, close enough she can map his heat signature without trying—seventeen warms radiating like personal aurora.

"We should tell each other things," Emma announces suddenly. "Real things. In case—"

"Don't," Marcus cuts her off.

"No, she's right," Jennifer says. "I want someone to know. I cheated on my boyfriend. Three times. With his roommate."

The confession opens floodgates:

"I'm not actually pre-med. I'm failing chemistry."

"I stole money from my parents."

"I'm in love with my best friend's girlfriend."

"I haven't been to class all quarter."

The confessions circle the room like the water below—rising, inevitable.

"What about you?" Emma asks Chloe. "What's your secret?"

Chloe looks at the walls blazing with UV paint only she can see. At Hale, whose entire being exists in frequencies others can't perceive.

"I see colors that don't exist," she says.

"We all see weird stuff right now," Brad dismisses. "Stress hallucinations."

"No. Always. Since birth. I have four types of color cones instead of three. I see a hundred million colors where you see three million."

"That's not real," Marcus says.

"It's called tetrachromacy," Jennifer says unexpectedly. "We studied it in my neuro class. It's real. Rare as fuck, but real."

"You can see... more?" Emma asks.

"Different. I see into UV spectrum. And—" Chloe hesitates, then decides if they're dying, truth matters. "I have synesthesia. Colors become sounds become tastes become temperatures. Everything translates into everything else."

"Prove it," Brad challenges.

Chloe looks at him, lets her full perception unfold:

"Your fear tastes purple-metallic with edges of green. When you speak, your voice looks like yellow triangles. Your body temperature varies in twelve distinct zones—highest at your throat where panic lives, coolest at your fingers which you keep clenching. The playing card you're holding—seven of hearts—has a UV watermark from where someone with lotion touched it. The lotion had SPF, which glows at 380 nanometers."

Brad drops the card.

"The walls," Emma breathes. "You can actually see something on the walls."

"Paintings. Hundreds of them. UV paint. Three years worth." She looks at Hale. "All his."

"Why?" Jennifer asks him. "Why paint where no one can see?"

Hale's quiet for a moment. Then: "Because someone could see. Even if I never met them. Even if they never knew. Someone, somewhere, had the eyes to see. So I painted for them."

"For her," Brad says, understanding. "You painted for her specifically."

"I painted for whoever could see. It happened to be her."

"That's impossible. The odds—"

"One in seventeen million," Hale says. "I looked it up. Tetrachromacy with UV perception. One in seventeen million."

"And you just happened to both be here?"

"No," Chloe says. "We were called here. By the paintings. By the patterns. By each other."

---

## Hour Five: The True Conversation

Water reaches their ankles. Cold that transcends temperature, that her synesthesia translates into a color like death—black with edges of silver-white, the color of endings.

"Everyone on the desks," Marcus orders. "Highest ground."

They crowd onto the three desks, pressing close. Chloe ends up next to Hale, their bodies touching along one side—seventeen points of contact her brain processes as seventeen different colors, a rainbow only she can see.

"Tell me about the paintings," she says quietly, needing to understand before—before whatever comes.

So he does. Quietly, like bedtime story, like prayer, like confession. October third, the first spiral after seeing her arrangement. November fifteenth, the seventeen birds after she'd spent a day counting migrating pelicans. December first, the calendar painting after her advent Instagram posts.

"This one—" He points to a complex pattern near the ceiling. "January seven, last week. After you arranged those shells on the beach."

"You saw that?"

"I follow your Instagram. @ChloeMartinezArt. Been following since October."

"That's—" She wants to say creepy but it's not. It's desperate. It's lonely. It's exactly what she would have done.

"Invasive? Yes."

"Beautiful," she corrects. "To know someone was seeing. Even if I didn't know."

"The shimmer you mentioned. You really see heat trails?"

"From you, yes. Only you. Seventeen different temperatures that linger in air after you pass. Like ghost doubles. Like you exist more densely than other people."

"What do I look like? To you?"

Strange question when they might die. But also the only question worth asking.

"Like a galaxy," she says. "Like all the colors that shouldn't exist decided to become a person. Like art that learned to walk."

He laughs—sound that looks golden in her peripheral vision, tastes like honey mixed with snow.

"What do I look like to you?" she asks.

"Like the answer to a question I didn't know I was asking."

Water at their knees now. The others are crying, praying, calling families again. But Chloe and Hale exist in a bubble of impossible perception, speaking in frequencies only they can hear.

---

## Hour Six: The Phone Call That Changes Everything

Hale's phone rings again. Different ringtone—personal, not official.

He answers in Swedish, rapid-fire. His face changes—hope? Fear? Something between?

He hands the phone to Chloe. "For you."

"Hello?"

"Is this Chloe Martinez?" Female voice, older, authoritative.

"Yes?"

"Dr. Karina Lindqvist. Hale's mother. I'm at UC Berkeley. Neuroscience department. He says you're tetrachromatic."

"I—yes."

"With UV perception?"

"Yes."

"And you can see his paintings?"

"All of them."

"Listen carefully. I've been studying tetrachromacy for twenty years. Started when Hale was born—he has partial tetrachromacy. Not enough for full spectrum but enough to sense what he can't quite see. That's why he paints in UV. He's painting toward his partial perception."

"Partial—"

"One in thirty million. The odds of you two meeting—"

"One in infinity."

"Yes. You're matched pairs. Genetically, neurologically, perceptually matched. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

Water at their thighs. Time running out.

"We were meant to find each other."

"More than that. You complete each other's vision. Together you see spectrums that don't exist for anyone else, even other tetrachromats."

"How do you—"

"Because I've been looking for someone like you his whole life. Someone who could see what he paints toward. He paints what he almost sees. You see what he reaches for."

The phone cuts out.

"Your mother—" Chloe starts.

"Is why I knew to look for you. She's been researching tetrachromacy since I was diagnosed with partial. Said someday I'd find my match."

"Match?"

"Person who could see what I almost see. Person whose vision completes mine."

Water rising faster now. Up to their waists as they stand on the desks.

"If we die—" Chloe starts.

"We won't."

"But if—"

"Then we die seeing each other. Really seeing. How many people can say that?"

---

## Hour Seven: The Kiss and The Light

The water stops.

Just stops.

Waist-deep, but not rising.

"Something's changed," Marcus says. "A dam? Diversion?"

"Does it matter?" Emma asks.

"It means we might make it."

The room reorganizes again—from death preparation to survival hope. But Chloe stays pressed against Hale, reading the last paintings he did this week. Frantic ones. Desperate ones.

"These are different," she says, tracing a pattern from two nights ago. "More urgent."

"I felt you coming closer. Following the trails. Had to paint faster. Say everything before—"

"Before what?"

"Before you saw them. Before you ran. Before you realized I'd been watching, painting you, falling in—"

He stops.

"Falling in what?"

"Look at the ceiling."

She does. There, in UV paint so fresh it still drips, painted in the last hour while they've been trapped:

*Jag älskar dig*  
*Jeg elsker deg*  
*Te amo*  
*I love you*

Four languages. Same message. Painted over and over, a mandala of confession.

"You don't know me," she says.

"I know you see seventeen warms when I touch things. I know you count colors compulsively. I know you arrange objects in patterns that match paintings you've never seen. I know you're the only person who can see what I create. I know you stayed on campus during break because being alone is easier than pretending to be normal. I know—"

She kisses him.

Not desperate. Not frantic. Slow. Like they have forever instead of minutes.

The kiss creates its own spectrum in her synesthetic perception—not metaphor but literal neurological event. Her four types of cones fire simultaneously. Colors explode behind her eyelids: gold-silver-pearl with edges of UV she has no name for. The kiss tastes like electricity and snow, like midnight and noon occupying the same moment. It sounds like symphony written in frequencies only she can hear—seventeen different notes corresponding to seventeen different temperatures where their bodies touch.

Time dilates. Each second stretches into minutes. The water stops existing. The frightened people disappear. The universe contracts to the space between two people who see impossible things, finding each other in disaster.

When they part, she's crying. But the tears taste sweet—relief mixed with recognition mixed with something that might be love if love can bloom in flood.

"Look," Emma gasps.

They turn.

Lights. Outside. Helicopters. Multiple. The sound of salvation arriving exactly when they'd given up hope.

---

## Hour Eight: What Remains

Chaos. Rescue baskets. One person at a time. Chloe and Hale pushed to opposite sides as the room reorganizes around evacuation.

"Women first," someone says.

"Injured first," the rescue worker corrects through the megaphone.

"We stay together," Hale shouts across the chaos. "Chloe, we stay—"

But she's already being pushed toward the window, the basket, salvation.

"Your name," she shouts back. "Your full name!"

"Hale Marcus Lindqvist! Uppsala! February nineteen—"

The rest lost in rotor wash.

She's in the basket. Rising. Away from him. Away from the UV paintings. Away from the only person who exists in as many dimensions as she can perceive.

But she remembers the paintings on the walls. The conversation they had before they knew they were having it. The seventeen warms that will let her find him anywhere.

The helicopter rises, and she sees the campus transformed into ocean. Sees the tower like a lighthouse in the dark. Sees, in UV frequencies visible only to her through the rain, his message glowing on every surface:

*Find me.*  
*I'll find you.*  
*We already found each other.*

The water might separate them. Different helicopters. Different hospitals. Different evacuations.

But they speak in frequencies others can't perceive. They'll find each other the way they did the first time—through impossible colors, through invisible art, through patterns that match across any distance.

The helicopter banks toward the hospital.

Below, the flood continues.

Above, their conversation continues too—painted in light only they can see.

---

## Part 9: The Physics of Drowning

**[1:45 AM - Water at window level]**

Marcus is calculating.

"Based on the rate of rise and the tower's height—"

"Don't," Jennifer says. "Please don't tell us when."

"Knowledge is power."

"Knowledge is terror when you can't do anything with it."

He tells them anyway: "Forty-five minutes. Maybe an hour if the rain stops."

It won't stop. They can all hear it—hammering the bells above, turning the world liquid.

"We should write messages," Emma says suddenly. "In case—you know. So people know we were here."

"We're not dying," Brad says, but his voice cracks.

"Just in case."

Hale pulls out his UV markers—waterproof, thank god. Starts passing them around.

"No one will see these," someone protests.

"Chloe will." He's certain. "She sees everything."

So they write. On walls, on desks, on their own skin. Messages in frequencies most will never see:

*Jennifer was here and she was brave*
*Brad actually has feelings*
*Marcus calculated beauty in disaster*
*Emma learned colors have names*
*Fifteen people became one frequency*

Chloe adds her own:

*We existed in impossible spectrums*
*We made art from drowning*
*Love persists in frequencies beyond visible*

That last one makes Hale look at her.

"Love?"

"What else do you call this?"

"This?"

"Us. Here. Now. Creating while dying."

"We're not dying."

"We're not living normally either."

"No," he agrees. "We're living in between. In the frequencies between life and death."

"The mellanrum," she says, remembering his Swedish words.

"The space between. Where impossible things happen."

---

## Part 10: The Group's Transformation

**[2:00 AM - Water keeps rising]**

Something changes in the group dynamic. Maybe it's the proximity to death. Maybe it's watching Chloe and Hale paint love letters in UV. Maybe it's just flood logic.

But they start talking. Really talking.

"I've been pretending," Brad says suddenly. "About everything. My whole life is performance."

"We know," Jennifer says, not unkindly.

"I hate my major," Marcus admits. "Philosophy is just elaborate ways to avoid feeling things."

"I can't actually make pottery," Emma confesses. "I just like the idea of it."

One by one, they shed their masks. The water rising strips everything false.

"I see colors," one girl says—Chloe doesn't know her name. "Not like you, Chloe. But more than normal. Always have. Never told anyone."

"I hear math," another student admits. "Equations have sound. Pi sounds like rain."

"I taste words," someone else says. "Certain words. Love tastes purple."

They're all broken in beautiful ways. All seeing/hearing/feeling things that don't fit normal.

"Maybe that's why we're here," Hale says. "All of us. In this tower. Maybe floods call to people who exist in margins."

"That's ridiculous," Marcus says, then: "But also maybe true."

They paint more messages. Not just UV now—regular paint, markers, anything. Creating evidence of their existence. Of their impossible perceptions.

The tower becomes gallery of the almost-drowned.

---

## Part 11: The Promise Pattern

**[2:10 AM]**

"We need a plan," Chloe says. "For after. When we get separated."

"If we survive," Jennifer corrects.

"When. When we survive. We need to know how to find each other."

"Exchange numbers," someone suggests.

"Our phones are dead. And who can remember fifteen numbers?"

"Thirteen," Brad corrects. "Thirteen numbers."

They count. He's right. Somehow they've gone from fifteen to thirteen. When did that happen? Who left?

"Tom and Sarah," Emma remembers. "They climbed out the window. Earlier. When the water was lower."

"Did they make it?"

No one knows. No one will know.

"Twelve," Marcus says quietly. "If we're being honest. Jeremy's been unconscious for an hour."

They look at the corner where Jeremy—engineering major, quiet, always wore the same hoodie—slumps against the wall. Breathing but barely.

"We can't leave him," Emma says.

"We won't. But we plan for twelve."

Twelve people. Twelve promises to find each other.

"Everyone paint something only you would paint," Chloe suggests. "Your signature. So we can recognize each other's work later."

They do.

Brad paints skateboard wheels in perfect circles.
Marcus writes philosophy quotes in tiny script.
Emma draws pottery that doesn't exist.
Jennifer makes patterns of pills—her anxiety medication, rendered beautiful.

Each person creating their identifier.

"Now we'll always know," Chloe says. "If we see these patterns, we'll know who survived."

"When," Emma corrects. "When we see them."

---

## Part 12: Hale's History

**[2:20 AM]**

"Tell me about Sweden," Chloe says.

They're pressed together on the desk—everyone is, human raft against rising water—but she needs to know him. Needs more than eight hours.

"What about it?"

"Everything. Your family. Your art. Why you came here."

"Now?"

"Especially now."

So he tells her. Voice low, others listening but pretending not to.

His mother the neuroscientist. His father who left when Hale started seeing colors wrong. The diagnosis at seven—partial colorblindness that was actually partial tetrachromacy. The years of being told he was broken.

"Then I found UV paint. Age fifteen. Suddenly I could create what I saw."

"But no one else could see it."

"Story of my life. Invisible boy making invisible art."

"Why California?"

"Scholarship. Also..." He hesitates. "My ex. Swedish girl. Also artist. She got into UCLA, I followed."

Jealousy, sharp and unexpected. "What happened?"

"She could see my art. Regular vision but something about her perception—she could see UV. We thought it meant something."

"It didn't?"

"It did. Just not what we thought. She could see the art but not me. Saw the creation but not the creator."

"Where is she now?"

"No idea. We broke up two years ago. She said I was too invisible. Ironically."

"You're not invisible."

"No?"

"No. You're the most visible person I've ever seen."

"You're the only person who's ever seen me."

"Then everyone else is blind."

He kisses her temple. Soft. Quick. But she feels it in seventeen places.

---

## Part 13: The Final Rise

**[2:30 AM]**

Water at their chests now. They're all standing on desks, pressed together, sharing body heat and terror.

Jeremy's stopped breathing.

No one says it but everyone knows.

Eleven now.

"We should sing," Emma suggests.

"What?"

"Sing. Something. Together. So we're not just standing here waiting to—"

"What song does everyone know?" Marcus asks.

They try. Amazing Grace—only half know the words. The National Anthem—too depressing. Happy Birthday—someone starts crying.

Then Hale starts humming. Something wordless, melodic. Swedish maybe, or just human.

Others join. Not words, just tones. Harmonizing by accident or instinct.

The water rises.

They sing.

The tower fills with sound and water, both reaching for the bells above.

And then—

The water stops.

Just stops.

Three inches from the ceiling. Room to breathe. Barely. But room.

"Did we—did our singing—?" Emma can't finish the question.

"Coincidence," Marcus says.

"Miracle," Jennifer counters.

"Physics," Chloe says. "The water reached equilibrium. The pressure equalized."

But she's looking at Hale when she says it, and they both know:

Whatever just happened, it wasn't normal physics.

It was the physics of impossible things. The physics of people who see colors that don't exist. The physics of love during disaster.

The physics of survival through art.
