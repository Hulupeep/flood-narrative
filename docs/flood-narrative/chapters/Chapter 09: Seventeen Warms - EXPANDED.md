# Seventeen Warms
*September 18, 2024 - Coffee Shop on State Street*

---

## Part 1: Seventeen Minutes Early

The coffee shop on State Street smells wrong.

Not bad—just wrong. Like a painting copied from memory by someone who never learned to see the underlayers. Too much vanilla, not enough dust, and the vanilla itself reads amber-white with blue disaster-edges that spell out twenty months of everything-changed. The kind of wrong only someone with broken perception would notice: when you see too much, you taste the frequencies of what's missing.

Chloe arrives seventeen minutes early.

Of course seventeen. Everything is seventeen now.

Parks herself at the corner table where she can see both entrances, the window, the back exit she mapped within seconds of arrival. Habits from twenty months of searching—always watching for a tall Swedish silhouette that never appeared.

Until yesterday.

"What can I get you?" The barista—nose ring, flood survivor tattoo on her wrist—hovers with practiced patience.

"Just water. I'm waiting for someone."

"Date?". Over familiar.  Wrong country. Forced. 

"Research meeting."

The barista smirks. " I could do with some research myself. Been months."

Bitchy. Or Flirty. Not sure. She should stop talking.

"It's about parallel creation during trauma separation."

"he cute?"

"I didn't say it was a he."

"You didn't have to. You've checked the door seventeen times since you sat down."

Seventeen. Always seventeen.

Chloe's hands automatically arrange the sugar packets by their color frequencies—white has twelve variants if you count the UV spectrum bleeding through the window. Sweet'N Low pink screams at wavelength that tastes like artificial strawberries. The brown sugars sing bass notes only she can hear.

"Nervous habit," she says.

"The counting or the arranging?"

"Both."

"My ex did that. The arranging thing. Said it helped with anxiety."

"Did it?"

"No. We broke up during the flood. He took a different helicopter."

The barista walks away before Chloe can respond. Different helicopters. The phrase lodges in her chest like shrapnel.

2:47 PM.

## Part 2: The Hovering

She sees him before he enters.

Not him—his reflection in the gallery window across State Street, wavering in afternoon light that hits at thirty-seven degrees exactly. The same angle that makes UV paint blaze visible. Coincidence or calculation? With him, everything is calculation. He's been standing outside for three minutes and seventeen seconds—she counts his micro-movements, the weight-shift from foot to foot, the way his fingers drum against his thigh in patterns that match her own nervous arrangements.

He's nervous. More than nervous—terrified.

His heat signature bleeds through glass and window-space and twenty months of separation: purple-gold anxiety shot through with silver threads that taste like the moment before you jump from something very high. The color of someone deciding whether to run toward or away from the thing that might save them or destroy them completely.

Her phone buzzes. Text from Maria:
*"How's the 'research meeting'?"*

She types back: *"He's been standing outside for three minutes."*

*"Nervous?"*

*"We both are."*

*"Why? You already kissed during apocalypse. This should be easy."*

Should be. Isn't.

She texts: *"Apocalypse kiss doesn't count."*

*"All kisses count."*

*"Not if you think you're dying."*

*"ESPECIALLY if you think you're dying."*

Hale moves. Finally. Hand on door handle. Still not pulling.

Another text from Maria: *"Is he coming in or not?"*

*"Unknown."*

*"Want me to come push him?"*

*"No."*

*"Want me to come push YOU?"*

*"Maria. Stop."*

*"You spent 20 months looking for him."*

*"I know."*

*"So stop texting me and go talk to him."*

But then he turns, and their eyes meet through two panes of glass, across twenty feet of space, and her tetrachromacy explodes into recognition—

Seventeen. Always seventeen. Seventeen different blues in his eyes even from this distance. Seventeen degrees of warmth radiating from his body. Seventeen micro-expressions crossing his face in the span of one breath.

He enters.

---

## Part 3: The Awkward Beginning

"Hi."

"Hi."

They stare. The coffee shop continues around them—espresso machine hissing, students typing, world spinning—but they're frozen.

"You came," she says. Then immediately: "Obviously you came. You're here. That was stupid."

"Not stupid."

"Obvious though."

"I almost didn't."

"Come?"

"Mm."

"Why?"

"Because what if—" He stops. Swallows. "What if yesterday was—what if we imagined—"

"The connection?"

"The everything."

She wants to reach across the table but doesn't. Not yet. "We didn't imagine it."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're still seventeen."

"Seventeen?"

"Different temperatures. Where you're warm. I can count them. See them. You're the only person who registers as seventeen."

"That's—"

"Impossible. I know."

"I was going to say specific."

"That too."

Awkward pause. He looks at the wall—local art display. One piece has a small gallery sticker in the corner: 'Holbrook Contemporary.' His jaw tightens. His heat signature spikes—anger-orange bleeding into the seventeen warms.

"You know that gallery?" she asks.

"James Holbrook. His father's gallery."

"The one who—"

"Accused me. Yes."

"Why is his art here?"

"His art is everywhere. Money buys wall space."

"Is that why you paint in UV? Where money can't buy visibility?"

He looks at her sharply. "Maybe. I hadn't thought—maybe."

---

## Part 4: The Research Project Pretense

"So," he says. "Research project."

"Right. Research."

"You want to document—what exactly?"

"Um. Parallel creation during trauma separation."

"That's very specific."

"And unconscious communication through invisible art."

"Even more specific."

"Too specific?"

"Very oddly specific."

"I could make it broader—"

"No. Specific is good. We're specific."

The barista approaches. "Ready to order?"

"Chamomile tea," Hale says.

"Still just water," Chloe says.

"You sure? We have seventeen different coffee drinks."

Seventeen. Chloe and Hale both freeze.

"Sorry, not seventeen exactly," the barista corrects. "Like sixteen or eighteen. I just said seventeen randomly."

"Seventeen's good," Chloe manages.

The barista leaves, confused.

"She said seventeen," Hale says.

"Coincidence."

"You don't believe in coincidence."

"Since when?"

"Since you spent twenty months creating patterns that matched paintings you couldn't see."

"That's not—that was—"

"What?"

"I don't know what that was."

"Me neither."

"So we're researching it."

"To figure out what we are?"

The question hangs.

---

## Part 5: Testing What's Real

"Can I ask you something?" Chloe says.

"Anything."

"In the tower. When we—when you kissed me—"

"When we kissed each other."

"Right. That. Was it because we thought we were dying?"

"Yes."

Her heart drops.

"And no," he continues. "And also something else."

"That's three answers."

"It's a three-answer question."

"Explain."

"Yes, because dying made me brave. No, because I wanted to before the water. Something else because—" He stops.

"Because what?"

"Because when I kissed you, I saw colors."

"What?"

"I have partial tetrachromacy. You know this. Your mother—"

"Dr. Lindqvist told me. On the phone. During flood."

"I can't fully see what you see. But when we touched—when we kissed—edges. Borders. Like almost seeing but more."

"You saw through my eyes?"

"Or we created new frequencies together. I don't know."

His tea arrives. He wraps his hands around it—seventeen different temperature zones that make her mouth flood with the taste of memory.

"Can I try something?" she asks.

"What?"

"Give me your hand."

"Why?"

"Research."

He extends his hand across the table. Stops halfway. "What kind of research?"

"The kind where I prove you're real."

"You think I might not be?"

"Twenty months of looking. Twenty months of nothing. Then suddenly you're everywhere—library, UV messages, coffee shop. Maybe I'm having breakdown. Maybe you're trauma hallucination."

"How would touching prove—"

She takes his hand.

---

## Part 6: The Seventeen Warms Confirmation

The connection is immediate. Seventeen different temperatures, but more—seventeen different textures, pressures, micro-vibrations that her synesthesia translates into:

"Copper-mint-snow," she says out loud.

"What?"

"How you feel. Taste. Through my fingers. Copper like electricity, mint like winter, snow like Sweden."

"That's impossible."

"Count the temperature points."

He closes his eyes. She can feel him focusing, trying to perceive what she perceives.

"I feel... five? Maybe six different—"

"Seventeen. Always seventeen. Your thumb is 99.1 degrees. Index finger 98.7. Middle finger 97.9—"

"You memorized my temperatures?"

"I memorized everything. The way your pulse maps through your palm. The callus on your right index finger from holding brushes. The scar on your knuckle—"

"From before flood."

"When?"

"Three years ago. First week painting UV. Cut myself on campus maintenance ladder."

"The night you painted 'For someone who might feel'?"

He stares at her. "How could you know that?"

"October third. Two thirteen AM. I was in the library and felt—pulled. Like gravity sideways. Walked to window and saw someone crossing the quad. Tiny figure. Couldn't see details but knew—knew—you were about to create something."

"That's—"

"Impossible. Everything about us is impossible."

---

## Part 7: The Confession Attempt

"I need to tell you something," he says.

"Okay."

"Several somethings."

"Okay."

"I painted you. These twenty months. Every day. Sometimes twice."

"You showed me the photos—"

"No. I mean—I painted you on myself. UV ink. Under clothes where no one could see."

"Why?"

"Because I thought I was going crazy. Seeing you in every pattern. Every arrangement of objects looked like your frequency."

"My frequency?"

"You have specific frequency. Like—" He struggles for words. "Like radio station but light. You broadcast at wavelength only I can perceive."

"That's—"

"Insane. I know."

"I was going to say romantic."

"Romantic?" He laughs, but it's edged with disbelief. "I tattooed myself with invisible ink because I couldn't stop seeing someone who might not exist. That's not romantic. That's psychiatric."

"Show me."

"What?"

"The paintings. On you. Show me."

"Here?"

"Not—just the ones you can. Arms maybe?"

He rolls up his sleeves.

---

## Part 8: The UV Tattoos

The scars are precise. Geometric. But that's not what makes her gasp.

It's the UV ink painted over them. In coffee shop light, barely visible to normal eyes. But to her tetrachromatic vision—

"That's me."

Not portraits. Abstracts. But unmistakably her frequency, her pattern, her specific way of existing in space.

"Seventeen parallel lines," she counts.

"June fifteenth. Six months after flood. When I thought you were dead."

"But you kept painting."

"Differently. On myself. Where only you could see if you existed."

"I existed. I was painting too. Just... differently."

She pulls out her phone. Shows him photos. Twenty months of arrangements. Pencils, leaves, books, stones—all in patterns that mirror his UV paintings.

"Look at the dates."

He scrolls through. His breath catches.

"June fifteenth. You arranged seventeen stones."

"I didn't know why. Just had to. Compulsion."

"July second—"

"The spiral of shells. You painted—"

"The same spiral. That night."

"August tenth—"

"September third—"

"October—"

They're both talking now, overlapping, finding dozens of moments where they created the same patterns, same day, sometimes same hour, across a city, without contact.

"How?" he asks.

"I don't know."

"Quantum entanglement?"

"Tetrachromatic perception of connections?"

"Shared delusion?"

"All three?"

---

## Part 9: The Other Witnesses

An old couple enters. The woman stops, stares at their table.

"Oh," she says to her husband. "Look at them."

"What?"

"Can't you see it? The light?"

"What light, Helen?"

"Between them. Like—like aurora but small. Personal."

"You're imagining things."

"I'm not—" She looks directly at Chloe. "You see it too, don't you? The impossible colors?"

Chloe nods, speechless.

The woman has tetrachromacy. Partial, like Hale. Can't see everything but sees something.

"Forty years I've been seeing light between people," the woman says. "Never seen it this bright. You two are—what are you?"

"We don't know," Chloe admits.

"Well, whatever you are, don't let go. That kind of light—" She shakes her head. "Once in a lifetime. If that."

She leaves them staring at each other.

"Someone else sees," Chloe whispers.

"Not everything."

"But something."

"Enough to know it's real."

---

## Part 10: The Decision

"I need to ask you something," Chloe says. "And I need real answer. Not romantic answer or trauma answer or what you think I want to hear."

"Ask."

"Do you think this is real? Us? Or is it just—proximity and crisis and chemical response?"

He's quiet for long moment. Then:

"In Swedish, we have word. *Verklig*. Means real. But root means 'work.' Something is real if it works. If it functions."

"Does this function?"

"We found each other through invisible art. We communicate in frequencies others can't see. We create same patterns without trying. What do you think?"

"I think we're impossible."

"But?"

"But we work."

"So we're *verklig*."

"Real because we function."

"Even if impossible."

"Especially because impossible."

He moves around the table. Sits beside her. Close enough she can map his seventeen warms without trying.

"What happens now?" she asks.

"Now we research ourselves. Document everything. Prove connection beyond trauma."

"Together?"

"Is there another way?"

"We could—separately study—"

"Can you separately study a frequency that only exists between us?"

"No."

"Then together."

"Your place or mine?"

He laughs—real laugh, not edged with anything except surprise. "That's very forward for research."

"I meant for the project. The documentation. The—"

He kisses her.

Not like the tower kiss—that tasted like ending.

This tastes like beginning. Like coffee shop normalcy and afternoon light and no water rising and time to learn each other without death circling.

"Your place," he says when they part. "Mine still has UV paint on everything. Might be overwhelming."

"Mine has patterns. Arrangements. Twenty months worth."

"Perfect. We can map them. See where they match my paintings."

"Very professional."

"Completely research-focused."

"Absolutely."

They're both smiling now. Not the desperate smiles of flood night but real ones. Sustainable ones.

"One more question," she says.

"What?"

"Do you believe in fate?"

"No."

"Then how do you explain us?"

"I don't. That's why we need research."

"Very scientific."

"*Vetenskaplig*."

"What's that?"

"Scientific in Swedish. But literally means 'knowledge-like.' We're creating knowledge about something that didn't exist before."

"Us?"

"The frequency of us. The seventeen warms. The impossible colors. The conversation we've been having for three years without knowing."

"That's beautiful."

"That's *verklig*."

Real.

They leave together, walking into afternoon light that hits at thirty-seven degrees, making UV visible to her eyes, making their connection visible to anyone with the ability to see.

Behind them, the barista clears their table, finds the sugar packets arranged in perfect spectrum formation, takes a photo without knowing why.

The conversation continues.

Now conscious.

Now together.

Now real.

## Part 9: The Intervention

*[September 19, 2024 - The Next Day]*

Emma brings backup.

Chloe finds them in her apartment when she returns from campus—Emma, plus Jessica from Art History, plus Mika from her old Color Theory class. An intervention staged in her own living room, complete with concerned expressions and printed articles.

"We need to talk," Emma says.

"About what?"

"About him. The Swedish guy. Hale."

Chloe's enhanced vision immediately maps their emotional states: Emma radiating orange worry-waves, Jessica pulsing anxious purple-blue, Mika broadcasting protective frequencies that taste like cinnamon and fear.

"What about him?"

Jessica holds up her phone. Screenshots. Forum posts. Cached pages.

"Chloe, he was arrested. For extremist activities."

"Charges were dropped."

"That's not the point," Mika says. "Look at this stuff. Norwegian black metal connections. Invisible messaging. They say he hid fascist symbols in UV paint around campus."

"That's not what happened."

"How do you know?" Emma sits on the coffee table, forcing eye contact. "You've spent exactly four hours with this guy. Two years ago during a disaster, then coffee yesterday. What do you actually know about him?"

Chloe wants to explain—about the unconscious conversation, about four hundred ninety-seven paintings, about seventeen different warms and colors that don't have names. But how do you tell normal people about impossible connections?

"I know he sees things others can't see."

"That's exactly what we're worried about," Jessica says. "The articles mention psychological instability. Paranoid thinking. Seeing things that aren't there."

"I see things that aren't there too."

"That's different. Your condition is real. Medical. This guy—" Jessica scrolls through screenshots. "This is someone who thinks the government is hiding messages in campus architecture."

"He doesn't think that."

"How do you know what he thinks? Chloe, be honest—when you're with him, do you feel like yourself?"

The question stops her. Because the answer is no. With Hale, she feels like more than herself. Like the person she was meant to be when her neurons first mapped color to consciousness. Like her impossible perceptions aren't flaws to be managed but gifts to be shared.

"I feel seen," she says.

"That's exactly what manipulation feels like," Mika says gently. "Love bombing. Making you feel special, understood, unique. Classic predator behavior."

"He's not a predator."

"Maybe not intentionally. But trauma bonding is real. Shared crisis creates artificial intimacy. You both almost died in that tower—your brains formed connections that feel like love but are really just survival response."

Emma leans forward. "We're not saying he's evil. We're saying you might not be thinking clearly."

"I'm thinking more clearly than I ever have."

"Are you? Look at your apartment."

Chloe follows their gaze. Her living room has transformed overnight—books arranged by color temperature, furniture repositioned to optimize natural light spectrum, seventeen different objects placed at exact distances she can't explain but that feel necessary.

"You've been unconsciously arranging things since coffee yesterday," Emma continues. "Whatever's happening between you two, it's affecting your behavior in ways you don't seem to notice."

"That's not—"

"Chloe." Jessica's voice goes soft. Dangerous soft. "We looked up the prayer space incident. The hate crime. Even if he didn't do it, even if someone else was caught—he was the prime suspect for weeks. There were petitions. Student groups demanding his removal."

"Because of rumors. False rumors."

"Maybe. But where there's smoke—"

"There isn't always fire." Chloe stands, pacing to the window. In the late afternoon light, she can see UV traces on the glass—messages she didn't know were there until this moment. He was here. Left something for her. "Sometimes there's just people with matches trying to start fires where none exist."

"Or sometimes there's smoke because something's actually burning," Mika says. "And you're standing too close to see it clearly."

They sit in silence. Three friends who see normal colors trying to protect someone who sees impossible ones from a man who paints in frequencies they can't detect.

"What do you want me to do?" Chloe asks.

"Just... be careful," Emma says. "Don't isolate yourself. Don't stop hanging out with us. Don't make any big decisions until you've had time to process this without him influencing your perceptions."

"And if I don't?"

"Then we'll support you anyway. Because that's what friends do. But we needed you to know what we found. What people are saying. What it looks like from the outside."

After they leave, Chloe sits in her rearranged apartment, looking at the UV message on her window. In Swedish, in his careful handwriting:

*"De som inte kan se kallar synden för galenskap."*

Those who cannot see call vision madness.

She photographs it with her phone, knowing the camera won't capture what's really there. But she needs proof for herself—that the impossible is real, that being understood isn't manipulation, that sometimes the people who love you most are the ones who can't see what you see most clearly.

Outside, normal people drive home in cars, see normal colors, live normal lives.

Inside, she counts seventeen different frequencies in the window glass and wonders if the price of being understood is being misunderstood by everyone else.

---

## Part 6: The Walk Home

**[5:30 PM - Through campus]**

They walk slowly. No rush now. Twenty months of rushing, searching, missing—now they have time.

"Show me," Chloe says. "All the places you painted."

So he does.

The underpass where he wrote *Still here* 127 times in UV, each one dated.

The bench where he spent three nights painting her constellation—seventeen stars in the pattern of her heat signature.

The tree where he carved their initials like a teenager, then covered it with UV paint so only she would know.

"You turned the campus into a love letter."

"You turned your apartment into an answer."

They stop at each location. She photographs everything, even knowing the UV won't show. He explains the timeline—which messages when, what he was thinking, how many times he almost gave up.

"But you didn't."

"Neither did you."

"We're very stubborn."

"We're very Swedish," he corrects, then catches himself. "Well, I am. You're very—what's your heritage?"

"Mexican. Irish. Some German apparently."

"That explains the hair."

"The brown hair?"

"The seventeen different browns I can see in it."

She looks at him. Really looks. Catalogues every detail her tetrachromacy can process:

- The UV paint permanent under his nails (twelve different shades)
- The way his iris has forty-three distinct color zones
- The scar on his thumb that glows slightly different in infrared
- The heat signature that still reads exactly seventeen warms

"You're staring," he says.

"You're worth staring at."

"That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me."

"That's sad."

"That's Swedish."

They laugh. Keep walking. The campus transforms in the golden hour—that specific 6 PM light that makes UV visible for exactly seventeen minutes.

All around them, his messages blaze into visibility.

"My God," Chloe breathes. "You painted everything."

"I painted everywhere you might walk."

Hundreds of messages. Maybe thousands. Three years of invisible art suddenly visible in the perfect light.

"This must have cost a fortune. UV paint isn't cheap."

"I worked three jobs. Maintenance, night security, and under-the-table art restoration for the Holbrooks ironically."

"They hired you after accusing you?"

"They didn't know it was me. I used a fake name. Lars Holstrom."

"That's the name from the hospital records."

"I've been using it since the accusation. My invisible identity."

"But you're not invisible anymore."

"No?"

"No. You're the most visible person in Santa Barbara. You just painted yourself everywhere."

---

## Part 7: The Coffee Shop

**[6:00 PM - Mesa Café]**

Maria's coffee shop. She sees them through the window, starts crying before they even enter.

"You found each other."

"Technically, I found him," Chloe says.

"Technically, we found each other," Hale corrects.

Maria hugs them both. Hard. Like she's been holding her breath for twenty months.

"I knew it. I knew you were real." This to Hale. "She described you so perfectly I could see you even though I can't see UV."

"You know about—?"

"The tetrachromacy? The paintings? The seventeen everything? Honey, I've been living this search with her for twenty months."

She makes them coffee. Chloe's usual seventeen sugars. For Hale—

"Let me guess," Maria says. "Black. But you'll add exactly three drops of milk."

"How did you—?"

"Chloe told me. Twenty months ago. Said you were precise about measurements that didn't exist."

"They exist. Just not in standard metrics."

"See?" Maria says to Chloe. "Perfect for each other. Two people measuring impossible things."

Other customers stare. The girl who arranges everything and the mysterious Swedish painter—campus legends reuniting in public.

"Everyone knows," Chloe realizes.

"Everyone's been watching," Maria confirms. "Your Instagram has twelve thousand followers now."

"What?"

"You became famous. The girl searching for invisible love. People are obsessed."

Hale looks uncomfortable. "I don't like visibility."

"Too bad," Maria says. "You painted yourself across campus. You're visible whether you like it or not."

Her phone buzzes. She checks it, grins.

"What?" Chloe asks.

"Tommy. He says, and I quote, 'Holy shit the Swedish ghost is real tell him I have his vinyl it's at the bar he can pick it up whenever also does he want a job because I need someone who understands organization and Chloe says he's basically a savant with patterns.'"

"Tommy has my vinyl?"

"Tommy has everything. He's been collecting flood artifacts for almost two years. Has a whole shrine to survival."

"I need those records."

"They're yours. But—" Maria pauses. "Fair warning. People are going to want to meet you. The mysterious painter. The invisible boy Chloe spent twenty months seeking."

"I don't—"

"You don't have to meet anyone," Chloe interrupts. "We can stay invisible if you want."

"Can we though? Now that we've found each other?"

"We can do whatever we want. We survived a flood. We created impossible art. We found each other through frequencies that don't exist. I think we've earned the right to make our own rules."

Maria watches them. These impossible people having impossible conversations about impossible things.

"You know what?" she says. "First coffee's free. Second coffee's free. Hell, coffee's free forever. You two have provided me twenty months of entertainment."

"We're not entertainment," Chloe protests.

"No. You're art. Living art. The kind that makes other people believe impossible things can happen."

---

## Part 8: The Night Decision

**[8:00 PM - Outside Chloe's apartment]**

They stand at her door. The moment extending like UV light—invisible but present.

"I should go," Hale says.

"Should you?"

"It's been a long day. Twenty months long."

"That's why you should stay."

"Chloe—"

"Not for—I mean, just to talk. Or not talk. Just to exist in the same space. I've been looking for you for twenty months. I'm not ready to be apart yet."

"What about your roommate?"

"Don't have one. Couldn't. The arrangements made people uncomfortable."

"The patterns?"

"Everywhere. Compulsive. Getting worse."

"Show me."

She opens the door.

The apartment is a gallery of searching. Every surface covered in arrangements. Pencils in spirals. Books in color order only she can see. Coffee cups in configurations that map his heat signature.

"This is—" Hale stops. Stares. "This is my frequency."

"What?"

"The patterns. They match my painting frequency. Exactly. How is that possible?"

"I don't know."

"You've been unconsciously arranging things in 365-nanometer wavelength patterns."

"You've been painting in the exact frequency I can see clearest."

They look at each other. The impossible getting more impossible.

"We need to document this," he says.

"The professor thing?"

"The us thing. The way we're synchronized without trying."

"Is that what we are? Synchronized?"

"Among other things."

"What other things?"

Instead of answering, he starts rearranging her arrangements. Not destroying—enhancing. Adding his patterns to hers. Making visible what she's been creating blind.

She watches him work. Counts seventeen different ways his hands move. Realizes she's been arranging things in his hand-movement pattern without ever seeing him create.

"How is this possible?" she asks.

"I don't think possible applies to us."

"Then what does?"

"Inevitable."

"You don't believe in fate."

"I don't. But I believe in frequency. And ours matches exactly."

---

## Part 9: The Morning After

**[Next day - 7:00 AM]**

Chloe wakes to Hale painting on her window.

Not UV—regular paint. Watercolor. Visible to anyone.

"What are you doing?"

"Making us visible."

"I thought you hated visibility."

"I hated being invisible alone. Invisible together is different."

She watches him paint. It's their story but abstract—spirals that suggest searching, parallel lines that never quite touch, explosion of color where they converge.

"People will see this."

"Good."

"The Holbrooks might—"

"Let them. I'm tired of hiding. Tired of being Lars Holstrom. Tired of painting in frequencies only you can see."

"But that's our language."

"We'll still have it. But maybe we can have visible language too."

She joins him at the window. Picks up a brush. Adds her colors to his—the ones only she can see, making visible through regular paint what usually requires tetrachromacy.

Together they paint on her window. Visible art about invisible connection.

Outside, people stop. Watch. Take pictures.

"We're becoming visible," she says.

"We're becoming real."

"We were always real."

"But now others can see it."

The morning light hits at exactly thirty-seven degrees. The UV underlayer Hale added suddenly visible. The window blazes with seventeen different spectrums.

Someone below gasps. Then applauds.

Then more people. More applause.

They're clapping for art they can barely see. For connection they don't understand. For two people who found each other through impossible frequencies.

"What do we do now?" Chloe asks.

"Now? Now we create. Visibly. Invisibly. Everything in between."

"Together?"

"Is there any other way?"

"Not for us."

"Not anymore."

They paint until the window is complete—their story in every spectrum, visible and not, possible and impossible, real and surreal.

The coffee shop below puts out a sign: "Home of the Frequency Lovers."

Tommy texts about the vinyl.

Marcus emails about a gallery showing.

Dr. Chen's office calls about resumed therapy.

But Chloe and Hale just paint. Create. Exist in frequencies others are just beginning to see.
