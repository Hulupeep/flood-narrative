# Havsdans
*October 2024 - Two Weeks After Reunion*

---

## The Studio Setup

The warehouse isn't theirs. Can't afford their own. But Maria's cousin knows someone who knows someone who has this space in the Funk Zone, between a surfboard shaper and a kombucha brewery. Three months free if they fix the roof.

"This is it?" Chloe stands in the doorway, seeing seventeen different qualities of light streaming through broken skylights.

"Is perfect," Hale says, already measuring walls with his eyes. "North light through there. UV will hit at thirty-seven degrees from two to four PM. Your golden hour."

"Our golden hour."

"Ja. Ours."

The space is massive—5,000 square feet of concrete and possibility. Previous tenant left paint stains on the floor that Chloe's tetrachromacy reads as a history of creation: cadmium red from 2018, prussian blue from 2020, something that might be blood or rust from the flood.

"We'll need ventilation for the UV chemicals," she says, practical despite the seventeen different frequencies of excitement pulsing through her vision.

"Tommy's brother does HVAC. Trade for a painting."

"We don't have paintings yet."

"We will."

His confidence tastes golden—new phenomenon since the reunion. She can taste his emotions now, not just see them. The synesthesia evolving, deepening, becoming something beyond medical explanation.

The warehouse smells like possibility and sawdust.

Not metaphor—literal. Chloe's synesthesia translates the combination into color: gold-future with edges of silver-nervous. The sawdust from Hale building display walls. The possibility from what they're about to create.

"Pass the seventeen-millimeter," he says from the ladder.

"That's not a real measurement."

"Is in our language."

Their language. Two weeks of building it. Seventeen for anything about touch. Ninety-three for the flood. Four hundred ninety-seven for the number of UV paintings he made while searching.

She hands him the wrench. Their fingers brush—seventeen points of contact igniting like constellation mapped across skin. Sustainable now. Daily seventeen. Heat that builds cathedrals instead of burning forests.

## The Morning Routine

**[7:00 AM - Day 3 in the Studio]**

They've developed a routine without discussing it. He arrives first—6:30 AM, when the light is still gray. Makes coffee in the ancient machine Tommy donated. Swedish coffee, strong enough to dissolve spoons.

She arrives at 7:00, when the first UV rays pierce the skylights. Always carrying something—today, a box of pastels in colors that don't have names.

"Morning," she says, but it sounds like *I missed you* even though they were apart eight hours.

"Morgon," he replies, but it means *I painted you all night in my dreams*.

The coffee is waiting. Her mug (stolen from the university, PROPERTY OF UCSB PHYSICS DEPT) already filled to exactly the level she likes—room for milk she'll never add.

"You were painting," she says. Not a question. She can smell it on him—UV chemicals create a specific frequency in her nostrils, sharp like copper but sweet like morning.

"Couldn't sleep."

"The tower dream?"

"Different. Good different. Dreamed we were painting the sky. Actual sky. With brushes made of light."

"That's impossible."

"Everything we do is impossible."

She kisses him instead of arguing. Tastes coffee and UV paint and something that might be Swedish snow he carries in his DNA. The kiss creates its own light—she sees it reflected in the windows, seventeen different refractions.

"We should work," she says against his mouth.

"We are working. This is research."

"Into what?"

"How many colors a kiss creates."

"Seventeen thousand so far."

"Only?"

"It's early."

---

## The First Attempt

[Free indirect - voices starting to merge]

They stand before a blank canvas. Not blank—primed with something Hale mixed, a base that responds to both UV and visible light. Blank to most eyes. To hers: forty-three different whites, each with its own frequency.

"Together?" she asks.

"How?"

Good question. He paints in UV she can see. She sees colors he can't imagine. How do you create together when you exist in different spectrums?

"You paint what you feel," she says. "I'll paint what I see you feeling."

"Can you see feelings?"

"In you? Yes."

Always yes with him. His emotions have colors—doubt is purple-green, hope is gold-white, love is something that needs a new word.

He dips his brush in UV paint. Starts. She watches the colors that bloom from his movement—not just the paint but the intention, the gesture, the specific warmth of creation.

She adds her layer. Regular paint but in colors that respond to his UV, that answer questions he didn't know he was asking.

---

## Dr. Tanaka's Validation

[ONE privileged perception - partial witness]

"Extraordinary."

Dr. Tanaka circles their first collaboration. Even without full tetrachromacy, she sees something.

"The UV layer creates depth that shouldn't exist. And these colors—" She points to Chloe's additions. "They're not in any standard palette."

"We're making new ones," Chloe says.

"New colors?"

"New words for colors. New ways to see."

Dr. Tanaka pulls out equipment. Spectrometers. Modified cameras. "The grant committee will want documentation."

"No."

Hale's voice, sharp. Un-Swedish in its directness.

"No?"

"First we create. Then we document. Otherwise becomes about proving, not making."

[Status flip - artist asserting over scientist]

Dr. Tanaka steps back. Nods. Understands: This isn't just research. It's recovery. It's two people learning to exist in shared frequency after twenty months of separation.

---

## The Word Creation

[ONE tick-tock - subtle deadline]

"Exhibition opens in twelve weeks," Hale says. Not pressure. Just fact.

"We need language by then. For the catalog."

They've been creating words unconsciously. Now must be deliberate.

"Havsdans," Chloe says. "Sea-dance. For the UV that moves like water."

"Norrskimmer," he offers. "Northern shimmer. For your peripheral vision color."

"Mellanrum."

"Space between. For what exists where our spectrums overlap."

They write each word on the wall. By evening, they have forty-three.

"Forty-three," she announces.

"Forty-three what?"

"New words we've created. I count. Can't not count. The compulsion gets stronger when we're creating—like my brain needs to catalog everything we make."

He smiles. "Good number. Matches how many greens I see in your eyes."

"You can't see forty-three greens."

"No. But I can paint them because you describe them."

Their dictionary growing like their trust—slowly, deliberately, together.

---

## Tommy's Delivery

**[2:00 PM - Golden Hour Beginning]**

The door slams open. Tommy, carrying boxes that smell like vinyl and redemption.

"Special delivery for the miracle couple!"

"We're not—" Chloe starts.

"You survived a flood, found each other after twenty months, and now you're making impossible art. You're miracle couple. Deal with it."

He sets down three milk crates. Hale's rescued vinyl collection, dried and restored.

"How did you—?"

"Ultrasonic cleaning. My buddy at the record shop. Most are playable. Some are even better—water created unique patterns in the grooves. Accidental remixes."

Hale pulls out a record. Bathory. The one from the tower. Water-damaged but whole. Like them.

"This started everything," he says quietly.

"The Swedish death metal?"

"The recognition. When Chloe knew what it was. Knew I was real."

"I still don't understand that," Tommy says, opening a beer he's produced from somewhere. "How you knew obscure Swedish metal."

"I didn't. But I could see the frequencies in the vinyl. Each album has a different spiral pattern visible in UV spectrum. Bathory has this specific seventeen-spiral configuration."

"You're telling me you identified death metal by its UV signature?"

"I identified Hale by his UV signature. The metal was just evidence."

Tommy stares at them. "You two are either geniuses or completely insane."

"Both," they say simultaneously.

---

## The Breakthrough

Three days in. Five canvases attempted. Four disasters they've painted over. They've been careful. Professional. Scared to touch too much, as if their connection might dissolve in daily light.

Then Chloe drops her brush. UV paint splatters. Pattern on the floor that looks like—

"The tower," they say simultaneously.

The spill makes the shape of the carillon room. Accident that's not accident. 

"We should paint it," Hale says. "The flood."

"Why?"

"Because pretending it didn't happen won't make it not fundamental."

[Double-encoded moment]
[Surface: Should we paint the trauma?]
[Underneath: Should we accept what made us?]

---

## The Flood Piece

They paint their trauma.

Not illustration—translation. The water becomes color. The fear becomes frequency. The kiss becomes something visible only when UV and regular light combine at exactly thirty-seven degrees.

Chloe paints the seventeen warms of recognition.

Hale paints the twenty months of searching.

Together they paint the moment in the tower when truth became only currency.

"It's terrifying," Chloe says when they step back.

"Good terrifying?"

"Honest terrifying."

The painting pulses with their combined frequencies. Disaster and beauty inseparable. Loss and finding occupying same space. What the flood took. What it gave.

---

## Tommy's Contribution

[Breathing scene - community forming]

Tommy returns. Always returning with things—supplies, food, gossip from the art world.

"Holbrook's sniffing around," he says, no preamble. "Asking about Swedish UV artists."

Hale's hand stills on his brush. "James?"

"The son. Daddy owns galleries, junior wants to prove himself. Heard about your exhibition planning."

"How?"

"Marcus talks when he's drunk. Mentioned the flood couple making impossible art."

"We're not public yet," Chloe says. "The work isn't ready."

"Twelve weeks," Tommy reminds them. "That's what you told the gallery. Twelve weeks to create enough work for a full show."

"We know."

"I'm just saying, Holbrook's family has lawyers. And history. If they want to claim Hale's work—"

"They can't claim what they can't see," Chloe interrupts. "James doesn't have tetrachromacy. His father doesn't have it. They can photograph our work all they want—cameras can't capture what we're creating."

"But they can steal the concept."

"Let them try," Hale says quietly. "Let them paint in UV they can't see, create in frequencies they can't perceive, have conversations in spectrums they don't know exist. They'll create expensive nothing."

His anger has color—red-black with edges of Swedish winter. Chloe's never seen this shade from him before.

"Hey," she says, touching his arm. Seventeen points of contact, seventeen different calming frequencies. "We're invisible to them. That's our superpower."

"You're not invisible," Tommy says. "That's the problem. You're becoming very visible. The whole art world's talking about the flood survivors making multispectrum work. You need protection."

"We have protection. We have each other."

"That's beautiful, but it won't hold up in court."

"Tommy's right," a new voice from the door. Dr. Tanaka, carrying equipment. "You need documentation. Patents. Proof of creation dates."

"We're artists, not lawyers."

"In this world, you need to be both."

And just like that, Chloe sees their golden hour darkening—not the actual light, which still streams perfect through the skylights, but the probability light. The future frequencies shifting from gold-possible to gray-complicated.

But then Tommy pulls out something else. A record wrapped in plastic. Seven-color vinyl pressed in gradients that shift like aurora borealis. Even in regular light, Chloe can see seventeen different hues spiraling from center to edge.

"Botanical Lathe - 'Ecosystem,'" Hale reads from the sleeve. "I don't remember ordering this."

"That's the weird part. Look at the shipping label."

Attached to the plastic wrapping: a customs form, partly water-stained but still legible. CN22 declaration slip. Origin: Oulu, Finland. Sender: NordWax Archivist, D. Marchand.

"Foreign pressing," Tommy explains. "Looks like it got shipped to your storage unit by mistake. Wrong address or something. There's a note inside the sleeve."

Chloe watches Hale's fingers trace the customs form. His expression changes—recognition, then confusion, then something that tastes like hope mixed with possibility.

"What is it?" she asks.

He slides out the packing note. Small handwriting on archive-quality paper:

*My apologies for the shipping error. Item #003/5 was pulled incorrectly from inventory. Should have gone to H.E. Lindqvist, Lund University. Please return via enclosed prepaid label. - D. Marchand, NordWax Archivist*

"Lund University," Hale says quietly. "That's where I was supposed to go. Graduate program. Before the arrest. Before everything changed."

"Someone else named Hale Lindqvist?"

"Or someone who knew I was supposed to be there. This was shipped three years ago, according to the date. Right when I was applying."

Tommy peers over his shoulder. "Plot thickens. Want me to look into this Marchand guy?"

"Maybe. But first—" Hale holds up the seven-color vinyl. "Want to see what this sounds like?"

"Oh, and heads up," Tommy adds, suddenly remembering. "That Holbrook kid—James—he's been sniffing around. Asking about Swedish artists doing UV work. His dad owns like three galleries."

Hale's hand stills on the record. "When?"

"Last week. Maybe Tuesday? I told him I didn't know anything, but he seemed pretty interested. Watch your back, yeah?"

The seventeen warms in Chloe's palms pulse with new frequency—protective-red mixed with worry-purple. But there's something else now. The customs form, the note, the record that was meant for a different life. Evidence of connections they didn't know existed.

Hale holds the records like artifacts. Each one a story. The Bathory that started everything. The Permafrost he was framed for. The Violet Cold that sounds like Chloe's colors. And now this—the Botanical Lathe that found him by accident, carrying messages from strangers who might hold answers.

"Play one," she says.

He puts on something Swedish, atmospheric. The music fills the warehouse, and suddenly Chloe sees new colors—sound-colors, music making her tetrachromacy expand.

"I can see it," she breathes. "The music. It has color."

"What color?"

"Yours. The music is the color of your voice at 3 AM. The color of your hands building. The color of—"

She stops. Too much. Too intimate.

"The color of what?"

"The color of you existing near me."

---

## The Parents' Visit

**[Day 7 - Unexpected Interruption]**

"Chloe?"

She freezes. That voice. Here. Now.

"Mom?"

Her parents stand in the warehouse door—her mother elegant even in jeans, her father holding a casserole dish because of course he brought food.

"Maria told us where you were," her mother says, eyes already scanning, already seeing more than most. "This is your studio?"

"Our studio. Mom, Dad, this is Hale."

Hale wipes paint from his hands—UV paint they can't see but she can, glowing like seventeen small suns on his palms.

"Mr. and Mrs. Martinez," he says, accent thickening with nerves.

"You're the flood boy," her father says. Not unkind, but testing.

"I'm the flood man, yes."

"The one she searched for."

"The one who searched for her too."

They look at each other, these two men who love her in different frequencies.

"Show us the work," her mother says suddenly.

Chloe hesitates. "You won't be able to see all of it."

"I'll see enough."

And she does. Her mother—who might have tetrachromacy too, undiagnosed, unnamed—walks to their paintings and gasps.

"Oh, mija. Oh, this is—" She stops. Tears. "This is what you see?"

"Some of it."

"It's like—like noise but organized. Like symphony but visible. Like—"

"Like impossible things made real," her father supplies, though he's seeing less, understanding through faith rather than perception.

"Your grandmother," her mother says suddenly. "She used to arrange things. Obsessively. Said God spoke in patterns only she could hear."

"Hear?"

"See. Feel. Experience. There wasn't language for it. They called her loca."

"She wasn't crazy."

"No. She was like you. Seeing frequencies others couldn't."

Chloe feels something shift—family history rewriting itself in UV light. Generations of women seeing impossible things, called crazy for their gifts.

"Can you teach me?" her mother asks. "To see more?"

"I can try."

They spend the afternoon—Chloe teaching her mother to see UV edges, her father and Hale talking about Sweden and California and the strange miracle of finding someone who matches your frequency.

"You'll take care of her," her father says. Not a question.

"We take care of each other."

"That's the only way it works."

When they leave, her mother hugs Hale. Whispers something Chloe can't hear. He nods, eyes wet.

Later, Chloe asks what she said.

"Thank you for seeing her when we couldn't."

"You could see her."

"Not all of her. Not the colors. Not the frequencies. We loved her but we couldn't see her. You can."

"We see each other."

"Yes. That's the miracle."

---

## The Night Work

[Free indirect - voices merging completely]

2 AM. Can't sleep. Meet at warehouse without planning.

Find each other already there.

"Couldn't sleep."

"Couldn't sleep."

They work in silence that's not silence—brushes speaking, colors conversing, UV and visible light creating dialogue that doesn't need words.

This is what they did for twenty months apart. Created at the same time without knowing. Now doing it deliberately. Together. The conversation continuing but conscious.

By dawn, they've made something impossible—a painting that exists in seven different spectrums simultaneously. 

"What do we call it?" Hale asks.

"Mellanrum."

"The space between."

"Where we exist."

---

## Maria's Recognition

Maria brings food. Sees their work. Stops.

"You're in love."

Not a question.

"How—?" Chloe starts.

"It's visible. Whatever you're making. It looks like love having a conversation with itself."

Even without tetrachromacy. Even without seeing UV. Maria sees the truth—two people creating single language from different alphabets.

"Is it too much?" Chloe asks. "The paintings?"

"No, mija. It's exactly enough. It's what love looks like when it stops pretending to be anything else."

---

## Marcus's Commission

**[Day 10 - Business and Art]**

"I have a proposition."

Marcus stands in their warehouse, board shorts and gallery owner confidence clashing beautifully.

"We're not ready—" Chloe starts.

"Not the exhibition. Different. I have a collector. Japanese. Wants something that exists in multiple spectrums. Pays in cash. Lots of cash."

"We don't need—"

"You need supplies. UV paint costs fortune. The spectrometers you want cost more. This commission covers everything plus six months rent when this free period ends."

"What's the catch?" Hale asks.

"He wants to watch you create it. Document the process."

"No."

"Hale—"

"Our process is private."

"He's not public. Yakuza, probably. Collects impossible things. Has a Banksy original in his bathroom."

"Why us?"

"Because he has partial color blindness but sees UV. Reverse of normal. Your work is the only art he can fully experience."

Chloe and Hale look at each other. Have entire conversation in glances:

*Him: We don't need this*
*Her: But the supplies*
*Him: Compromises our process*
*Her: One piece. For security*
*Him: You think we should?*
*Her: I think we need options*

"One piece," Hale says. "He can watch but not interfere. No cameras that capture UV spectrum."

"Deal."

"And we need half upfront."

"Quarter."

"Half or nothing."

Marcus grins. "You're learning business."

"We're learning survival."

The collector arrives the next day. Mr. Yamamoto. Seventy years old. Missing a finger. Sees UV like noon sun but can't see red at all.

"Show me impossible," he says simply.

They do.

For six hours, he watches them create. Never speaks. Never moves. Just observes with eyes that see different impossibilities than theirs.

When they finish, the painting exists in three layers:
- Regular spectrum (for normal vision): Abstract chaos
- UV spectrum (for him): A garden in Kyoto he remembers
- Tetrachromatic spectrum (for Chloe): The intersection of memory and loss
- Combined (for all of them): Something beyond category

"How much?" he asks.

"It's not—we agreed on—"

"This piece. How much to buy?"

"It's not for sale."

"Everything for sale."

"Not this."

He nods. Respects refusal. "Then I commission ten more."

"We can't—"

"Over two years. Whatever you create. I pay now for future work."

The number he writes makes Chloe's vision go seventeen different shades of shock.

"This is—"

"Freedom," Mr. Yamamoto says. "To create without fear. To be impossible without starving."

They accept.

Later, Marcus reveals the truth: "He's dying. Pancreatic cancer. Wants to surround himself with art only he can see. You're giving him private miracles for his last months."

"We should give the money back."

"No. He's buying legacy. Proving impossible things exist. Through your work, he continues."

---

## The Final Piece

[ONE perception - love as visible frequency]

Last day before moving to the gallery. They've created forty-three pieces. Their entire story from first unconscious response to this moment.

"One more," Hale says.

"Of what?"

"Now. This. Us creating."

Meta-painting. Art about making art. But also—

"You want to paint us painting us?"

"Want to paint what happens in mellanrum. The space where you see my invisible and I paint your impossible."

They set up mirrors. Multiple angles. Paint themselves painting themselves painting. Recursive. Impossible. Perfect.

In UV: their hands creating.
In visible: their hearts visible.
In the overlap: love as actual frequency.

"What color is love?" Hale asks, mixing something new.

"Seventeen," she says. "Always seventeen. But seventeen to the power of seventeen. Seventeen seventeens. Infinite seventeens."

He paints that—seventeen layers of UV, each one different temperature.

She adds seventeen visible responses, each one different frequency only she can see.

Together: Seventeen becomes everything.

---

## The Night Before Exhibition

**[Twelve Weeks Later - Final Preparation]**

3 AM. The warehouse transformed into gallery. Forty-three pieces hung, lit, ready. Tomorrow—today, technically—the world sees what they've made.

"Scared?" Chloe asks.

They're lying on the floor, looking up at their work. From this angle, the UV creates constellation on the ceiling—seventeen stars mapping their journey from flood to now.

"Terrified."

"Of what?"

"That they won't see it. Any of it. That we've spent twelve weeks creating invisible nothing."

"Some will see."

"How do you know?"

"Because we found each other. In a flood. Through invisible paint. Against impossible odds. If that can happen, others can see."

"Your math. Always math."

"Probability. If I exist, others like me exist. If you exist, others like you exist. If we exist, others like us exist."

"How many?"

"Seventeen, at least."

He laughs. Pulls her closer. She maps his heat—seventeen warms, but evolved now. Seventeen base temperatures plus seventeen variations plus seventeen possibilities. Mathematical progression of intimacy.

"What if Holbrook comes?"

"He'll come."

"With lawyers."

"Probably."

"To steal."

"To try."

"And?"

"And he'll fail. Because you can't steal what you can't see. Can't claim what you can't perceive. Can't own frequencies you don't know exist."

"But he can cause problems."

"We're problems. Our existence is problem. Our art is problem. Our love is problem. Beautiful problems."

She kisses him. Tastes future—metallic and bright, uncertain but theirs.

"Ready?" she asks.

"For exhibition?"

"For everything. All of it. The visible and invisible and impossible."

"With you?"

"No other way."

"Then yes. Seventeen different yeses. Yes in every frequency."

The sun rises. Hits the warehouse at thirty-seven degrees. For four minutes, everything they've created becomes visible to anyone who looks.

Then it returns to being theirs—invisible, impossible, true.

The exhibition opens in nine hours.

Their real life begins now.
