# Different Helicopters
*January 10, 2023, 6:47 AM - Rescue*

---

## Part 1: The Blade That Cuts

The helicopter blade cuts morning into pieces.

*Whup-whup-whup*—each rotation slicing time thinner until Chloe can't tell if seconds are passing or stopping. The sound creates colors in her vision—metallic silver-blue choppi

ng through the gold-pink dawn. Her hand in Hale's. Seventeen different temperatures, but all of them cooling as the rescue basket descends toward them.

"Same helicopter," she says. Makes it a statement, not a question.

"Same everything."

"They can take us both."

"Look at it."

She does. The basket swaying on its cable, barely big enough for one person. Orange plastic and metal mesh. Built for efficient evacuation, not keeping people together.

"We'll make them take us both," she insists.

"How?"

"I don't know. We just—we will."

But already she can see the probability waves in UV spectrum—two different paths diverging from this moment. One where they stay together (fading, unlikely, gray). One where they separate (blazing, inevitable, iron-red).

"Chloe—"

"Don't. Don't say it."

"We'll find each other."

"Stop."

"After. When this is over—"

"Stop talking like we're saying goodbye."

But they are. Her impossible vision shows her that truth in seventeen different ways. The helicopter hovers, rotors beating reality into submission. The rescue worker leans out, assessing.

"You first!" The voice through megaphone. Female. Exhausted. Probably been flying all night pulling people from roofs, from trees, from water. "Young lady! You're showing signs of hypothermia!"

Chloe's not hypothermic. She's burning. Every place Hale touched her in the tower still radiates heat in seventeen different frequencies. But her lips are blue—she can see them reflected in the flood water below. Body saying one thing, perception saying another.

"Together!" Hale shouts back. "We stay together!"

"One at a time! Protocol! Weight limits!"

"Then I'll wait—"

"Sir, the water's still rising. This roof won't last. She goes first."

---

## Part 2: The Negotiation

"No." Chloe's voice surprises everyone, including herself. Strong. Clear. Cutting through rotor noise. "He goes first."

"Miss, you're showing severe cold exposure—"

"I'm fine. He's been in the water more. He pulled me up. He goes first."

It's a lie. They've both been in water equally. But she needs to flip the order, change the probability, fight the iron-red inevitable she sees spreading.

"Chloe, no—"

"Your English isn't as good. If something happens, if we get separated, I can explain better. Find you easier."

"That's not—"

"Please." She squeezes his hand. Tries to transfer meaning through seventeen warms. "Trust me."

The rescue worker is getting impatient. "Someone needs to get in now! We have seventeen more buildings to check!"

Seventeen. Always seventeen.

"I'll go," Hale says. "But—" He pulls her close. Whispers in her ear. Not English. Swedish. Words she doesn't understand but memorizes: "*Jag hittar dig. Jag lovar. Även om det tar åratal.*"

"What does that mean?"

"I'll find you. I promise. Even if it takes years."

The basket touches down on the roof. Orange plastic against gray concrete. Real against impossible.

"Now, sir! We need to go!"

Hale starts to let go. Chloe holds on.

"Your name," she says urgently. "Make sure they get your name right. Hale Lindqvist. Make them write it down. H-A-L-E."

"Why—"

"Just promise."

"I promise."

He lets go. Steps into the basket. It immediately starts rising.

"Wait!" Chloe runs to the edge. "Which hospital? Where are you taking him?"

"County General if there's room! Convention center if not!"

"I'll find you!" she shouts up at him.

But wind tears her words apart. The helicopter banks left. She watches his heat signature disperse:

37°C at one foot distance (touching)
31°C at ten feet (reaching)
24°C at thirty feet (leaving)  
18°C at fifty feet (gone)

And then something worse—his frequency shifts into spectrum she's never seen before. The color of increasing distance. Pearl-gray-nothing with edges that taste like iron and ending.

---

## Part 3: The Second Helicopter

"Another unit inbound!" The megaphone voice fading as the helicopter carries Hale away. "Two minutes!"

Chloe sits on the roof. Counts. Two minutes is one hundred twenty seconds. She gets to three hundred before accepting no one's coming.

The water has risen another six inches.

She could jump. Swim. But to where? Everything is underwater. Bodies float past—not people, she tells herself, just debris that looks like people. Don't look closer. Don't confirm.

Her phone, miraculously, still has 3% battery. No signal. She takes photos anyway—the water level, the direction Hale's helicopter went, the exact color of the sky at this moment. Evidence she'll need later when everyone tells her she imagined him.

Thunder. Not weather—another helicopter. Different model. Coast Guard, not County Emergency. Different destination, different protocol, different everything.

The basket descends.

"Get in! Now!"

She does. No argument left. The basket rises and she watches the tower shrink below. Their gallery. Their eight hours. Their impossible connection. All of it disappearing into flood.

Inside the helicopter: chaos. Five other survivors. All from different buildings. No one from Storke Tower. No one who saw Hale.

"Where are we going?" she asks the crew member.

"Goleta! Fairgrounds evacuation site!"

Not County General. Not the convention center. Completely different direction from where they took Hale.

"Can you radio the other helicopter? The one that just—"

"Lady, we've got thirty birds in the air and a thousand people still need pickup. No one's tracking individual evacuees."

"But—"

"You're alive. That's what matters."

Is it? She's alive but half her frequencies are missing. The seventeen warms have left with him. She's alive but incomplete.

---

## Part 4: The Wrong Name

Goleta Fairgrounds. Chaos orchestrated into sections. Red Cross. National Guard. Local volunteers. Everyone trying to create order from catastrophe.

"Name?" The woman with the clipboard looks kind but exhausted. How many names has she written today?

"Chloe Martinez."

"Building rescued from?"

"Storke Tower."

"Time of rescue?"

"Six fifty-five AM. About. Maybe seven."

"Anyone else from your location?"

"Yes. Hale Lindqvist. But he went in a different helicopter—"

"I can only register people at this site. He'll be logged wherever he was taken."

"Can you check? Please? The system must be—"

"The system is pieces of paper in boxes. Nothing's digital yet. I'm sorry."

She writes Chloe's information. Then: "Do you have someone to call? Family?"

"No. But I need to find—can I see the lists? From other sites?"

"Once they're compiled. Maybe tomorrow."

Tomorrow. Twenty-four hours. Anything could happen in twenty-four hours.

"I need to find him today."

The woman looks at her with profound sympathy. "Honey, everyone's looking for someone today."

She's right. The tent is full of people clutching phones, calling names, searching faces. The universal posture of loss—leaning forward, eyes scanning, hope fighting with fear.

Chloe gets in line for the phone bank. Thirty minutes. Finally her turn.

County General: "No Hale Lindqvist. We have a Lars something—Holstrom?"

"Is he Swedish? Art student?"

"I don't have that information."

"Can you check?"

"Ma'am, we have three hundred patients. I can't—"

She hangs up. Tries the convention center.

"Lindqvist? Spell that?"

"L-I-N-D-Q-V-I-S-T."

"No one by that name."

"Try Hale. H-A-L-E."

"First or last?"

"First."

"We don't search by first names."

"Please—"

"Next person needs the phone, miss."

---

## Part 5: The First Night

The Red Cross gives her a cot. A blanket. A sandwich that tastes like cardboard and good intentions. The woman next to her cries all night. The man across the row calls the same number over and over: "Pick up, Sarah. Please pick up."

Chloe doesn't sleep. Can't. Every time she closes her eyes, she sees probability waves:

- Hale at County General, looking for her
- Hale at the convention center, wrong name on his chart
- Hale somewhere else entirely
- Hale still on the tower
- Hale in the water
- Hale—

No. He's alive. She'd know if he wasn't. Wouldn't she? The seventeen warms would go cold. The UV frequencies would stop pulsing in her peripheral vision. Something would tell her.

But nothing tells her anything except silence.

3 AM. She gets up. Walks to the information table where a volunteer sorts through papers.

"I'm looking for someone."

"Aren't we all." Not unkind, just tired.

"Hale Lindqvist. Swedish. Art student. From Storke Tower."

The volunteer checks lists. "I have a Lars Holbrook from maintenance. Rescued from campus."

"That could be him. Where—"

"Transferred to UCLA Medical. Critical condition."

The world tilts. "Critical?"

"That's all it says."

"How do I get there?"

"You don't. Roads are still flooded. Maybe in a few days—"

"A few days?"

"I'm sorry."

Chloe returns to her cot. Lars Holbrook. It could be him. The name's wrong but everything's wrong. She's seen how chaos corrupts information, how tired volunteers misheard, how Swedish accents get lost in translation.

Critical condition.

She presses her palms together, trying to summon his seventeen warms from memory. Feels nothing but her own ordinary heat.

---

## Part 6: The Wrong Trail

Day Two. Phones work sporadically. Chloe borrows charges, begs for minutes, calls everywhere.

"UCLA Medical."

"I'm looking for Lars Holbrook. Or maybe Hale Lindqvist."

"One moment." Keyboard clicking. "We have a J. Holbrook."

"J?"

"James."

"Is he Swedish?"

"I can't provide that information."

"Is he from UCSB?"

"Ma'am—"

She hangs up. Not him. James, not Hale. But why is the universe giving her all these almost-names? Lars, Holbrook, J—like someone's scrambling the truth just enough to make it unfindable.

Maria finds her on Day Three.

"Chloe! Thank god!" Hugging, crying. "I thought—when they said the tower flooded—"

"I'm okay."

"You're not okay. You look—" Maria stops. "You were with someone. In the tower. Brad told me."

"Hale."

"Where is he?"

"I don't know."

The words break something. Chloe starts crying and can't stop. Maria holds her while she explains—different helicopters, wrong names, critical condition that might not even be him.

"We'll find him," Maria says.

"How? He's invisible. He was already invisible before—maintenance, UV painter no one could see. Now he's not even got his right name."

"Then we make him visible."

"How?"

"Social media. Post everywhere. Someone must have seen him."

They try. Post on every platform: "Looking for Hale Lindqvist, Swedish art student, rescued from Storke Tower."

Three people respond claiming to be him. None are.

Seventeen people respond with other missing Swedes. None match.

Four hundred people respond with their own missing loved ones.

Everyone's looking for someone. Hale disappears into the crowd of ghosts.

---

## Part 7: The Acceptance That Isn't

Week Two. The water recedes. Campus reopens for assessment. Chloe gets special permission to check Storke Tower.

The carillon room is destroyed. Water damage up to the fifth floor. The UV paintings—if they survived—are invisible under mold and mud.

But on the bell that didn't flood, the highest one, she finds something. Fresh UV paint. Still tacky.

*Jag lever*

She Googles it: "I live" or "I'm alive."

He was here. After the rescue. He came back and left this message where only she would look, in frequencies only she could see.

But when? Yesterday? Last week? An hour ago?

She searches the building. Calls his name. Nothing.

Security finds her on the roof at sunset, arranging debris in patterns that spell his name in UV frequencies.

"Miss, you can't be here."

"I'm looking for someone."

"Everyone's been evacuated. Weeks ago."

"He was here. He left a message."

"You need to leave."

They escort her out. Ban her from campus until "psychological evaluation determines fitness."

The evaluation determines she's suffering from "trauma-induced paranoid ideation with visual hallucinations."

They recommend medication that will "help with the false color perception."

She doesn't take it. The false colors are all she has left of him.

## Part 8: The Processing Centers

**[January 10, 2023 - Goleta Fairgrounds - 11:30 AM]**

The fairgrounds reek of disaster—diesel fuel from generators, wet clothes, fear-sweat, industrial coffee brewing in fifty-gallon urns. Chloe wanders through sections labeled with masking tape: MEDICAL, REGISTRATION, MISSING PERSONS, DECEASED.

She avoids the last one.

"Martinez! Chloe Martinez!"

She turns. David pushing through crowds, phone to his ear.

"I've got her," he tells whoever. Then to Chloe: "Your mom. She's been calling every shelter."

Takes the phone. Her mother's voice cracks across distance: "Mija, thank God—"

"I'm okay, Mom."

"The news said the tower—fifteen people trapped—"

"We all survived."

"We?"

"The people. From the tower. We're all okay."

Not a lie. Not the truth. They're all alive but scattered across different centers, different hospitals, different versions of survival.

"Come home," her mother says. "David will drive you."

"I can't. Not yet. I need to—"

"What you need is rest. Food. Your own bed."

"Mom, there's someone—"

"The Swedish boy. David told me."

Boy. Like Hale's just some college crush, not the person who makes impossible colors visible.

"I need to find him."

"You need to come home. You can look for him after—"

"After might be too late."

Silence. Then: "Chloe, honey, you've been through trauma—"

"This isn't trauma response."

"Meeting someone during disaster, it creates false bonds—"

"It's not false."

"How can you know that?"

How to explain? That she's been responding to his paintings for three years? That their connection predates their meeting? That she sees his heat signature in seventeen different frequencies?

"I just know."

Her mother sighs—sound that travels three counties. "Twenty-four hours. Come home for twenty-four hours. Rest. Then look."

"Mom—"

"Please. I need to see you're okay."

The mom-weapon: guilt wrapped in love.

"Twelve hours," Chloe negotiates.

"Twenty."

"Sixteen."

"Deal. David's driving you now."

---

## Part 8.5: The Drive Away

David's car smells normal—pine air freshener, gym socks, untouched by flood. Wrong. Everything should smell like disaster now.

"So," he says, navigating debris-strewn streets. "Swedish guy."

"Hale."

"You met him last night?"

"Yes. No. It's complicated."

"You said that before."

Through the window, Chloe watches cleanup crews, National Guard vehicles, news vans. The world reorganizing after catastrophe. Somewhere in this chaos, Hale's doing the same—or lying in a hospital bed, or already discharged, or—

"You're counting," David observes.

She is. Telephone poles. Seventeen. Always seventeen.

"Compulsion's worse when I'm stressed."

"Or when you're thinking about Swedish guy."

"His name is Hale."

"You love him."

Not a question.

"We just met."

"That's not an answer."

"David—"

"I saw your face. When you couldn't find him. Either you love him or you're having a psychotic break."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive."

He laughs. "Fair."

They pass UCSB campus. Flooded. Abandoned. Somewhere in there, the tower where everything changed. Where two impossible people found each other through frequencies only they could see.

"I need to go back," she says suddenly.

"Home? We're going—"

"The tower. I need to check the tower."

"It's flooded."

"He might have left a message."

"Chloe—"

"Please. Five minutes."

David sighs but turns toward campus.

---

## Part 9: The Tower Return

**[January 10, 2023 - 2:00 PM - Storke Tower]**

The tower stands in water like a lighthouse in a black sea. Three feet at ground level, maybe more. The carillon bells visible through shattered glass, silent now.

"You can't go in," David says.

"Just to look."

"Chloe—"

But she's already wading through the parking lot, water cold against her calves. The building locked, of course. But around back, a window broken by rescue teams.

She climbs through.

The stairwell is a waterfall in reverse—water flowing down from upper floors where windows broke. She climbs anyway, shoes squelching, leaving wet prints that disappear into general disaster.

The carillon room.

Their room.

Destroyed and beautiful. Water damage to the fourth bell. UV paintings invisible under mud—no, wait. There. Fresh paint over the water line. Still wet.

*Jag lever - HL*
*I'm alive*
*County Medical*
*Room 847*
*Find me*

Her heart stops. Starts. Races.

He was here. After rescue. Before she arrived. Always missing by minutes, by breath, by heartbeat.

She photographs the message with David's phone. Evidence. Proof he existed. Proof they existed.

"Chloe!" David from below. "Security's coming!"

She runs her fingers over the paint. Still tacky. Hour old, maybe two. If she'd come straight here instead of fairgrounds—

"Now, Chloe!"

She runs down, splashing through flooded floors. David pulls her into the car as security arrives.

"Did you find what you needed?"

She shows him the photo. He squints.

"I don't see anything."

"It's UV. I can see it."

"You can see UV?"

"I can see everything. Too much. Frequencies most people can't—it's called tetrachromacy."

"That's a real thing?"

"Everything about me and Hale is real. Impossible but real."

"County Medical?"

"Room 847."

"Then let's go."

"My mom—"

"Will understand. Eventually."

---

## Part 10: The Hospital Chase

**[January 10, 2023 - 2:45 PM - County Medical]**

Room 847 exists. This feels like miracle enough. 

But—

"Discharged," the nurse says, checking charts. "Two hours ago."

Two hours. She was at the fairgrounds arguing about Swedish names while he was here, writing room numbers in UV, waiting.

"Where did he go?"

"I can't share that information."

"Please. I'm his—" What? Girlfriend? Color-match? Frequency twin? "—emergency contact."

"If you were his emergency contact, you'd know where he went."

Logic like a locked door.

"Can you at least tell me if he was okay?"

The nurse softens slightly. "Hypothermia, mild. Exhaustion. Some cuts from debris. He'll be fine."

Fine. But where?

"Did he leave anything? A message?"

"Just the painting."

"Painting?"

"On the window. Maintenance is not happy. Some kind of special paint that won't come off."

"Can I see?"

"Are you family?"

"I'm his—we're—it's complicated."

Everything always complicated.

But the nurse—PATRICIA, her tag says—seems to understand complicated. Leads Chloe to the room.

On the window, invisible to most but blazing to her tetrachromatic eyes:

*CM*
*497 messages for you*
*Look everywhere*
*Carillon to coast*
*I'm painting us visible*
*- HL*

---

## Part 11: Hale's Parallel Path

**[Same day - Hale's perspective interwoven]**

He wakes in wrong light. Hospital light. American light. No Swedish gray, no familiar shadows.

"Mr. Lindqvist?"

They got his name right. Finally. After three attempts, two wrong charts, one near-miss with someone else's medication.

"Where—" His English scattered. Happens when exhausted. "The girl. From tower. Chloe Martinez."

"I don't have information about other patients."

"Not patient. Was with me. Rescued first."

"I'm sorry, I can't—"

He's already getting up. Hospital gown ridiculous, but his clothes are somewhere, hopefully dry.

"Sir, you need to rest—"

"Need to find."

His English really gone now. Swedish creeping in. "Jag måste hitta henne."

"Sir—"

But he's found his clothes. Still damp but wearable. The UV markers in his pocket—miracle. Survived the flood.

Writes on the window while the nurse fetches the doctor. Has maybe minutes before they sedate him or restrain him or whatever Americans do to patients who insist on leaving.

497 messages. One for each arrangement she made. He counted from the tower windows. Saw them all. Been watching her create for three years without knowing who she was.

Now knows.

Now lost her.

Now has to find.

The doctor arrives. Young, tired, has been working since the flood started.

"Mr. Lindqvist, you need observation—"

"I sign. AMA. Against medical advice. I sign."

"The hypothermia—"

"Is mild. I'm Swedish. We have hypothermia recreationally."

Not a joke but the doctor laughs anyway. Exhaustion makes everything absurd.

"Where will you go?"

"To find someone."

"The girl from the tower? She was asking about you."

His heart stops. "When?"

"Earlier. At the fairgrounds. Red Cross Station B."

"How long ago?"

"This morning? Maybe noon?"

Hours. Always hours between them.

He signs papers. Seventeen papers, feels like. Everything in America requires seventeen signatures.

Outside the hospital, no money for taxi. Phone dead. But feet work. 

Walks to the fairgrounds.

She's already gone.

---

## Part 8: Twenty Months Begin

Month Two: She learns Swedish on Duolingo. Thirteen words a day. Starts with: *Jag hittar dig* (I'll find you).

Month Three: She gives up. Accepts he's gone. Lasts exactly one day before she's searching again.

Month Six: She creates art from her search. Arrangements of papers, photos, maps. Posts them on Instagram. Doesn't know she's responding to UV paintings she can't see.

Month Nine: She almost finds him. A Swedish artist in San Francisco. Takes a bus. It's not him. The man is sixty years old and paints landscapes.

Month Twelve: The anniversary. She returns to the tower. Finds new UV paint. Just three words: *Fortfarande här* (Still here). But he's not here. He's somewhere, painting messages she might never find.

Month Fifteen: She meets someone else. Normal. Can't see UV. Lasts two weeks before she realizes she's looking for seventeen warms in someone who only has one.

Month Eighteen: She stops searching. Keeps creating. The arrangements have become compulsive, necessary, like breathing.

Month Twenty: She sees new UV paint in the library. Fresh. Today-fresh. And then—

Then Chapter 1 begins.

The twenty months end where our story started: with reunion that feels like first meeting, with recognition that transcends time, with proof that different helicopters couldn't separate what exists in frequencies beyond visible.

But first, those twenty months of faith. Of creating without knowing. Of believing in someone who might be a flood dream, trauma response, beautiful hallucination.

Except he's not.

He's real.

He's been painting for her all along.

Different helicopters, same destination: back to each other.

It just took twenty months to get there.
