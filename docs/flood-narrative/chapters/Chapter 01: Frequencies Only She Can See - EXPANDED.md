# Frequencies Only She Can See
*September 17, 2024 - Twenty Months After the Flood*

---

## Part 1: The Bathroom Discovery

The message shouldn't exist.

UV paint invisible to normal eyes blazes across the bathroom stall door in letters that taste like copper-salt-snow. Swedish. Fresh. Still tacky when Chloe touches it with her fingertip.

*Hitta mig där vattnet började.*

Find me where the water began.

Her heart stops. Twenty months of searching, and suddenly someone's here—or was here, minutes ago, hours at most. The paint is that fresh. She can smell the chemicals, seventeen different compounds her eyes translate into impossible colors: benzene (purple-silver), toluene (gold-green), UV-reactive polymers (a blue that has no name).

It has to be him. The one she's been searching for.

"You okay in there?" 

Emma from orientation. Pottery major. Can't hear with her own heart thumping.  Standing right outside, probably worried about the girl who's been in the bathroom stall for ten minutes making sounds like she's either crying or having a revelation.

Both, actually.

"Fine." Chloe's hand hovers over the latch.

"You sure? You've been in there a while."

"Period stuff," Chloe lies. Universal excuse. Conversation ender.

"Oh. Do you need—?"

"I'm good."

 She could open the door.  Point. Say *look at the door. Tell me what you see.*

Her hand drops.

BECAUSE Emma won't see it.
THEREFORE Chloe stays silent.
BUT the message pulses like it's alive.

The toilet in the next stall flushes. Footsteps approach the sinks. Safe now to emerge. Chloe opens the door, walks to the mirror, doesn't look at Emma washing clay from her fingernails—gray clay that's actually seventeen different grays if you count the ultraviolet spectrum bleeding through, but who's counting?

She is. Always counting colors that don't have names.

Footsteps retreat to the next stall. Lock clicking. Safe now to study the message without looking insane.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Swedish. She's Googled enough Swedish phrases in the last twenty months to recognize the structure. The crowns over the a's—å's technically. The way the words flow like water themselves.

Find me where the water began.

Her mind translates the letters into taste—copper-salt-snow. That familiar taste. She knows it's from him without knowing how she knows. Twenty months since the flood, since the tower, since eight hours of thinking they'd die, and she still tastes those words like memory on her tongue.

"Oh my god," Emma says loudly back to her. "Did you see Marcus's post about the lagoon thing?"

"What?" Chloe forces herself to respond. Normal. Be normal.

"The commemoration. For the flood anniversary. Well, not anniversary—that was January. But like, for fall semester people who weren't here then?"

The toilet flushes. Footsteps to sink. Chloe counts to five, opens her stall door, walks to the mirrors. Doesn't look at Emma washing clay from her fingernails—gray clay that's actually seventeen different grays if you count the ultraviolet spectrum bleeding through each particle.

"He wants everyone there by four," Emma continues, working soap through her fingers. "Some kind of healing circle thing. Very Marcus."

Marcus. Philosophy major. Thinks trauma can be "processed" through "community witnessing." Wasn't here during the flood. Doesn't understand that some things can't be witnessed because they exist in frequencies others can't see.

"I have a thing," Chloe says.

"Come on. I know you were here during—" Emma stops. Recalculates. Her reflection shows the careful expression people get when they remember Chloe is Category Five Trauma—trapped in tower, nearly drowned, lost someone.

"Sorry. I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine."

"It's just, Marcus says communal healing—"

"I really do have a thing."

Emma rinses her hands. The water runs clear but Chloe sees the mineral content—twelve different compounds, each with its own spectral signature. Santa Barbara water. Different from before the flood. Everything's different after.

"Is it about him?" Emma asks suddenly.

"What?"

"The guy. The one you lost that night."

Chloe's throat closes. "How did you—?"

"Maria told me. Not details. Just that there was someone. That you've been looking."

Maria. Of course. Trying to help by spreading just enough information that people understand why Chloe photographs blank walls and arranges objects obsessively.

"He wasn't—we weren't—" How to explain? Eight hours of connection during disaster. A kiss that tasted like ending. Twenty months of searching for someone whose name was recorded wrong. "It's complicated."

"Love during trauma always is."

Love. The word hangs between them like UV paint—invisible to Emma, screaming to Chloe.

Emma dries her hands. "If you change your mind about the lagoon—"

"I won't."

"But if you do—"

"Emma." Chloe turns from the mirror. "I can't. The lagoon is where—where the water—"

"Where it began. I know. Maria told me that too."

Where it began. The same words from the UV message. Coincidence? Or is Emma seeing something she doesn't realize she's seeing?

"You keep looking at the stall door," Emma says.

Chloe freezes.

"Is there something—?"

"Graffiti. Someone wrote something gross."

"Ugh. People are disgusting." Emma doesn't look. Doesn't verify. Just accepts. "I'll report it to maintenance."

"No!" Too sharp. Chloe softens. "I mean, I already did. They're coming tomorrow."

"Cool." Emma heads for the door. Pauses. "Chloe? I know we don't know each other well, but if you ever want to talk about him—the guy from the flood—I'm here."

"Thanks."

Emma leaves. The bathroom empties. The afternoon light shifts—3:49 PM. One minute left of visibility.

Chloe returns to the stall. Studies the message. Takes a photo, though she knows the UV won't show up on her phone's camera. Only her eyes can capture this frequency.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

The water began at the library. Ground floor. Where she first saw his UV paintings three years ago, before she knew who created them, before the flood, before everything.

3:50 PM. The light shifts. The message disappears.

But the taste of copper-salt-snow remains.

## Part 1.5: Maria's Orchestration

**[Earlier that morning - 11:30 AM - Campus Coffee Shop]**

"You're doing it again."

Maria slides into the seat across from Chloe, two coffees in hand. One black with seventeen sugars (Chloe's bizarre preference since the flood), one cortado with oat milk (Maria's sophisticated choice).

"Doing what?"

"Arranging." Maria points at the sugar packets. Seventeen packets in a spiral that pulses with significance only Chloe can see.

"It's just—"

"A compulsion. I know. But it's worse lately."

It is worse. The arrangements more frequent, more complex. Like something's building, approaching, demanding expression through her hands.

"Dr. Chen says it's my brain processing—"

"Dr. Chen hasn't seen you do this for twenty months." Maria leans forward. "Chloe, you're responding to something."

"To nothing. To ghosts. To a person who probably—"

"Don't." Maria's voice sharp. "Don't say dead. You don't believe that."

She doesn't. Can't. If Hale were dead, wouldn't the colors change? Wouldn't the seventeen warms go cold? Wouldn't something in the universe tell her?

"The library got new UV lights," Maria says suddenly.

"What?"

"For the restoration. Special ones. They installed them yesterday."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you're going to go look anyway. Might as well know what you're walking into."

"I'm not going to—"

"Chloe." Maria's voice gentle now. "I've been your friend for four years. I watched you search for twenty months. I know you check the library walls every week."

"Every two weeks."

"This week you've been there three times."

How does she know?

"Because I love you, you disaster. And because—" Maria pauses, looks away, looks back. "Because I've been seeing things too."

"What things?"

"UV paint. Fresh. On campus."

Chloe's heart stops. "You can't see UV."

"Not the paint itself. But I see him. Painting. Night shift when I'm closing the coffee shop. Tall, blonde, Swedish-looking. Always painting where you'll walk."

"Maria—"

"Three nights this week. Same guy. And Chloe—" Maria pulls out her phone, shows a blurry photo. Figure in maintenance uniform, back turned, painting something on brick. "I followed him once. To the library."

"When?"

"Last night. He was there for hours. Whatever he painted, it's waiting for you."

"Why didn't you—"

"Tell you immediately? Because you need to find him yourself. Not have me deliver him. The finding is part of it."

"Part of what?"

"Whatever impossible thing you two are creating."

Chloe stares at the photo. Could be anyone. Could be Hale. Could be twenty months of wishful thinking made pixel.

"What if it's not him?"

"Then it's not. But Chloe—what if it is?"

"Go to the library," Maria continues. "After orientation. Check the walls. The bathroom in the art building too—third stall."

She stands, leaves her cortado untouched. "Oh, and Chloe? I may have told Emma just enough so she'd understand why you need space. Not everything. Just... enough."

"Maria—"

"Trust me. Some things need witnesses. Even invisible things."

She's gone before Chloe can respond. The sugar packets remain in their spiral. Seventeen points of sweet possibility.

So when Emma mentions Maria in the bathroom, Chloe understands. Maria's been orchestrating, preparing, creating space for reunion.

## Part 2: The Shimmer at Thirty-Seven Degrees

Outside, September heat slams into her like memory.

Not just heat—seventeen different temperatures, her skin mapping microclimates. The eucalyptus trees read 74.3°F in shade, 89.7°F in sun. The concrete burns at 97.2°F through her shoes. The air itself has layers—ground heat at 91°F, chest level at 88°F, the breath-space at 86.4°F.

"Yo, Martinez!"

Brad. Modernism seminar. Thinks Pollock was overrated. Currently leaning against eucalyptus tree, rolling a joint with practiced precision.

"You coming to Marcus's circle jerk at the lagoon?"

"That's not what he called it."

"Might as well be. 'Healing through communal witnessing.' Fucking please." He lights up, takes a drag. "Like anybody who wasn't here could understand."

He was here. She remembers now—his name on survivor lists. Engineering building. Different evacuation route. Still has nightmares, probably, but performs cynicism like armor.

"You going?" she asks.

"Fuck no. I don't need to sit in a circle and share my trauma with people who think flooding is when their basement gets damp."

The tree behind him shimmers.

Not the heat-wave kind of shimmer. Something else. Like reality hiccupping in frequencies that taste purple-gold-silver. She's been seeing it for weeks now, always in peripheral vision, always in places where—

"You okay? You're doing that thing."

"What thing?"

"The staring at nothing thing. The counting colors that aren't there thing."

"They're there. You just can't see them."

"Right. Your superpower." He offers her the joint. "This might help. Or make it worse. Probably worse."

"I'm good."

"You're something." He studies her. "Maria says you're looking for someone."

Christ. Maria's told everyone.

"She's worried about you," Brad continues. "Says you've been creating patterns. Leaving breadcrumbs for someone who might not exist."

"He exists."

"How do you know?"

"Because—" She looks at the shimmer behind him. Stronger now. Pulsing. "Because I can see their work."

"Their work?"

"UV paintings. Messages. Someone's been leaving them where they knew I'd look."

Brad's expression shifts. "That's either romantic as fuck or creepy as hell."

"It's neither. It's just—communication."

"With someone you haven't seen in twenty months?"

"Yes."

"Someone whose name you don't know?"

"I know their name. The records had it wrong."

"Someone who might be dead?"

The shimmer explodes into recognizable pattern. Not random. Deliberate. Arrow-shaped, pointing toward—

"I have to go," she says.

"The library?" Brad's not stupid. Sees her trajectory. "That's where you're going? Where it flooded worst?"

"Where the water began."

"Jesus. You're all crazy. Every one of you tower survivors."

Maybe. But crazy doesn't make it less real.

She walks away. Behind her, Brad calls out: "If you find them—your ghost or whatever—tell them they've got good taste in hiding spots!"

She doesn't respond. The shimmer-trail leads straight to the library, growing stronger with each step.

## Part 3: Maria's Discovery

Her phone buzzes. Maria. Again.

"Don't go to the lagoon thing."

"Wasn't planning to."

"Good. But also, you need to see something."

"Maria—"

"Library. Lower level. Now."

"Why?"

"Just come. Trust me. It's about the paintings."

The UV paintings. The ones she's been photographing for weeks without telling anyone she can actually see them. The ones that appear overnight and disappear by morning, painted over by maintenance but somehow returning.

"Which paintings?"

"The ghost ones. The ones you pretend you can't see but totally can."

"Maria—"

"I know you see things differently, Chloe."

World stops. "What?"

"Your mom told me. When I called her after you wouldn't stop looking for Swedish guys named Lars. She explained about seeing things differently. The impossible colors thing. How you see frequencies others can't."

"She had no right—"

"She's worried. I'm worried. Everyone's worried."

"I'm fine."

"You arrange pencils for hours. You photograph blank walls. You see things that aren't there."

"They are there. Just because you can't see them—"

"That's my point. Come to the library. There's new work there. Fresh paintings. And Chloe? I think whoever's been creating them is getting bolder."

The phone slips. She catches it. "What do you mean?"

"More complex patterns. Layered messages. Like they're building up to something."

"Maria—"

"You need to see this. It's different from before."

She runs.

---

## Part 4: The Library Descent

The library still smells like flood.

They've replaced everything—carpet, walls, books—but water has memory, and that memory lives in frequencies beyond smell. Her synesthesia translates it into color: gray-green-brown with edges of metallic yellow. The taste of disaster on her tongue.

The stairs to the lower level are new but feel old. Each step down increases the shimmer in her peripheral vision. By the time she reaches the bottom, it's almost unbearable—purple-gold-silver screaming at frequencies that make her teeth ache.

Maria waits by the new age philosophy section. Somehow that survived—universe's joke. Books about crystals and energy when real energy moves in UV wavelengths through painted walls.

"Finally," Maria says. "Look at this. The patterns are incredible."

Chloe can't answer. Can't breathe. Because there on the wall—layers upon layers of UV work. Fresh paint still drying. Complex geometric patterns interwoven with Swedish text. Mathematical sequences that pulse with familiar rhythm.

"This is new," she whispers.

"From this morning, I think. Still wet in places."

"Seventeen."

"What?"

"Seventeen different message layers. Nobody else would create seventeen."

Maria looks at her with concern. "Chloe, are you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

Maybe she has. The ghost of possibility. Of connection. Of someone who creates in the same impossible frequencies she perceives.

"Look at the wall," Chloe says, her voice barely a whisper.

Maria looks. Sees beige paint. Maybe some water stains.

"Now look through this." Chloe hands her phone with UV filter app.

The wall explodes into visibility—layers of paint, Swedish words, mathematical patterns, and in the center, painted just today: a portrait. Not realistic. Impressionistic. But unmistakably Chloe, rendered in wavelengths that shouldn't exist.

"Holy shit," Maria breathes.

"Someone's been painting me. Without seeing me. For months."

"And you've been arranging responses. The patterns you make—they match these paintings exactly."

"How is that possible?"

Chloe stares at the portrait, her heart hammering. Twenty months of searching, and here's proof someone has been watching, creating, responding to her unconscious signals in frequencies only she can see.

"I don't know," Chloe admits. "But they're here. Somewhere. Creating art only I can see."

"This is freaking me out," Maria says. "Also, this is beautiful. Also, what the fuck?"

---

## Part 5: The Realization

Chloe stares at the wall, her mind racing. The patterns, the Swedish text, the mathematical sequences—all of it familiar, all of it speaking to her in frequencies she thought only she could perceive.

"Maria," she says slowly, "show me the photo again. The one from last night."

Maria pulls up the blurry image on her phone. Figure in maintenance uniform, back turned, painting.

"He was here for hours," Maria says. "Working on this wall. Adding layers."

"Twenty months," Chloe whispers. "Five hundred ninety-three days of searching."

"You counted?"

"Every one."

Chloe approaches the wall, studying the UV work through her phone's filter. The Swedish text reads like poetry, like promises, like messages meant for eyes that can see beyond the visible spectrum.

"They know me," she says. "Whoever's doing this—they know exactly what I can see. What I respond to."

"The arrangements you make. Your patterns. They're responses, aren't they?"

Chloe nods. "I've been answering. Without knowing. Creating patterns that match these paintings."

"You've been having a conversation for months without knowing it was a conversation."

"In frequencies that don't exist for anyone else."

Maria shakes her head. "This is impossible. Beautiful, but impossible."

"Everything about this is impossible," Chloe says. "But look." She points to a section of the wall. "The message in the bathroom. 'Where the water began.' It led me here."

"To the library."

"Where I first saw UV art three years ago. Where the flood started. Where—" She stops, realization hitting. "Where they knew I'd come."

"So what now?"

Chloe looks at the fresh paint, still tacky in places. Seventeen different layers of meaning, all created for her impossible eyes.

"Now I wait," she says. "They're getting bolder. More direct. They'll reveal themselves when they're ready."

"And if they don't?"

"Then I keep creating. Keep responding. Keep faith that invisible doesn't mean alone."

Maria nods, understanding. "Want me to stay?"

"No. This is something I need to face alone. When it happens—when they decide to step out of the shadows—I need to be ready."

"I'll keep watch from upstairs. If you need anything—"

"I know. Thank you, Maria. For everything."

Maria leaves, and Chloe is alone with the impossible art, waiting for its creator to emerge from twenty months of hiding.

---

## Part 6: The Decision

Chloe stands alone in the library, surrounded by impossible art. The UV paintings pulse with fresh meaning—twenty months of messages, finally decoded. Someone has been creating for her eyes, responding to her unconscious patterns, maintaining faith across impossible distance.

She pulls out her phone, starts photographing the walls. Not that the camera can capture UV frequencies, but she needs to document this moment. The moment she stops being passive receiver and becomes active participant.

Moving to the far wall, she finds a section of blank space. From her bag, she pulls out a black marker—not UV, but visible to anyone who looks. In careful letters, she writes:

"I see you. I've always seen you. Now show yourself."

The message feels inadequate compared to the artistry surrounding her, but it's honest. Direct. No more games played in frequencies others can't perceive.

Her phone buzzes. Text from Maria: "Security guard coming. Says someone reported vandalism."

Chloe looks at her visible message, then at the invisible gallery surrounding her. Time to go. But first, she adds one more line:

"The lagoon. Tomorrow. 4 PM. If you're ready to stop hiding."

Footsteps on the stairs. She caps the marker, slips it into her bag, and heads for the exit. As she climbs toward ground level, she feels something shift in the air behind her—like recognition, like decision, like someone finally ready to step out of the shadows.

But she doesn't turn around. Some meetings require proper staging. Tomorrow at the lagoon—where the water began, where the flood started, where impossible connections might finally become visible to more than just her impossible eyes.

The library door closes behind her with the soft thud of anticipation.
