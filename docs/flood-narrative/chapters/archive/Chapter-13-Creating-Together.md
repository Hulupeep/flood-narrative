# Chapter 13: Creating New Art Together
*October 2024 - Two Weeks After Reunion*

The warehouse in the Funk Zone smells like possibility and sawdust.

Marcus has connections—his advisor's brother owns the space, usually rents it for tech startups, but after hearing their story, offered it for three months at almost nothing. "For the flood survivors creating beauty from disaster," he'd said, and Chloe had to arrange her pencils to keep from crying.

Now she watches Hale transform the space. He's building display walls, installing UV lights alongside regular spots, creating what he calls "revelation zones"—areas where invisible art becomes visible depending on where you stand.

"Pass me the seventeen-millimeter," he says from the ladder.

"That's not a real measurement."

"It is in our language."

She hands him the wrench, noting how comfortable they've become with their shared vocabulary—seventeen is always about touch, about the specific warmth between them. Twenty-three is her anxiety at its peak. Ninety-three is the flood, always.

"This one needs UV panel B," he says, and she wheels over the light they've modified together—her sight guiding which frequencies to include, his engineering making it real. They work in synchronization that feels both new and ancient, like recovering a skill they were born with but forgot.

Dr. Tanaka arrives at noon with equipment—spectrometers, cameras with modified filters, a computer system for documenting their color library.

"The grant came through," she announces. "Full funding for six months, with possibility of extension. The National Science Foundation is very interested in practical applications of tetrachromacy research."

"Practical applications?" Chloe asks, mixing a blue that doesn't have a name yet—the color of Hale's voice when he's concentrating.

"Art that helps other tetrachromats recognize their condition. Diagnostic tools using color perception. Environmental monitoring—apparently you can see pollution patterns others can't." Dr. Tanaka sets up her laptop. "But first, we need to establish baseline documentation. Chloe, I need you to identify every distinct color in this." She holds up what looks like a plain white card.

"Thirty-seven," Chloe says immediately. "No, thirty-eight. There's a pearl variant in the corner."

Hale stops working, comes to look. To him, it's white. Just white. But he's learning to trust her vision, to paint what he can't see based on her descriptions. It's an act of faith that moves her every time—painting invisible colors because she says they're there.

"Now this one." Dr. Tanaka holds up another card, this one with UV-reactive ink.

"Without UV light, it's twelve variants of gray. With UV—" Hale flips the switch on panel B. "Oh. Oh wow. It's like—it's singing. Two hundred and seven distinct frequencies, and they're moving, shifting, like—"

"Like what?" Hale asks, already reaching for his paints.

"Like the northern lights you showed me in that video, but underwater, but also—" She stops, frustrated by language's limitations. "I need a new word."

"Make one," he suggests. "We're building a dictionary anyway."

She thinks. "Havsdans. Sea-dance. Swedish and English, like us."

He smiles—the real smile, not the careful one he wore their first week back together. "Havsdans it is."

They work through the afternoon, Chloe identifying colors, Hale mixing paints to match, Dr. Tanaka documenting everything. By four o'clock, they've created forty-three new color names, identified twelve previously unknown tetrachromatic perception patterns, and Hale has painted something extraordinary—a canvas that shifts from visible to invisible to partially visible as you move around it, telling the story of their connection in spectrums most people can't see.

"This is unprecedented," Dr. Tanaka says, reviewing the data. "We're not just documenting tetrachromacy, we're creating a rosetta stone for invisible perception. Other tetrachromats will be able to use this to understand their own vision."

Maria arrives with food—tamales from her cousin's restaurant—and Tommy appears with jazz records from his collection, "For the exhibition opening. You need music that exists in multiple frequencies, like your art."

As the sun sets, painting the warehouse in golden light that Chloe sees as a symphony of warmth, she realizes something: they're not just creating art or conducting research. They're building a community of people who understand that invisible doesn't mean alone.

"Hey," Hale says, coming up behind her as she arranges their color samples on the display wall.

"Hey."

"We're doing it. The thing we talked about in the tower."

"Not drowning?"

"Making the invisible visible. Together."

She turns in his arms, sees the paint in his hair—three different blues from today's work. "I want to show you something."

She leads him to the corner she's been working on privately, reveals a canvas she's been painting—her first attempt at visual art rather than just arrangement. It's abstract but somehow clearly him: seventeen shades of black showing his hair in every light she's seen it, the pearl-silver of his Swedish words, the UV frequencies of his hidden paintings all made visible in regular paint.

"It's you," she says. "The way I see you."

He's quiet for a long moment, then: "No one's ever seen me before. Not really."

"I do. I see you painting at 3 AM thinking no one's watching. I see you leaving beauty in invisible frequencies. I see you choosing to be visible now, even though it terrifies you."

"What else do you see?"

"Someone who saved me in the flood but was already saving me before that, with paintings I didn't know I was seeing. Someone who makes my impossible vision feel like a gift instead of a curse. Someone who—" She stops, not ready for the word love, not yet, but feeling it in colors she hasn't named.

"Someone who what?"

"Someone who makes me want to create new words for everything I see, because the old words were made by people who couldn't see what we see together."

He kisses her then, surrounded by their emerging exhibition, their color library, their dictionary of impossible beauty. She sees colors behind her eyelids—not the drowning colors of their flood kiss but new ones: creation-gold, recognition-silver, the specific blue of finding that what you thought was trauma was actually transformation.

"Three months until the exhibition," he says against her lips.

"We'll be ready."

"I don't mean the art. I mean—three months of this. Creating together. Building our language. Proving what we have is real."

"Still worried about trauma bonding?"

"No." He pulls back, looks at her with those seventeen blues she's now painted from every angle. "I'm worried about the opposite. That this is so real it's going to rewrite everything I thought I knew about connection."

"Good," she says. "Let it rewrite everything. We're already rewriting how people see color. Why not rewrite how we see love?"

The word hangs between them—love—not quite spoken but visible now, like UV paint under emergency lighting.

"Havsdans," she says finally. "This feeling. It's havsdans too."

"Sea-dance for love?"

"For everything that moves in spectrums we're still learning to see."

They return to work, but closer now, their movements synchronized like dancers who hear the same invisible music. Outside, Santa Barbara continues its evening routines, unaware that in a Funk Zone warehouse, two people are creating a new language for impossible colors, for invisible art, for love that began in disaster but transforms into something as complex and beautiful as seeing ninety-three shades of the same blue.

"Tomorrow we start the flood room," Hale says, looking at their plans. "Are you ready?"

"To recreate the worst night of our lives?"

"To transform it into art."

She takes his hand—seventeen warms, always—and squeezes. "Together?"

"Together."

The warehouse holds their work, their future exhibition, their growing love. But more than that, it holds proof: that invisible frequencies can be made visible, that trauma can become transformation, that two people seeing in different spectrums can create something neither could imagine alone.

The art is just beginning.
The real masterpiece is them.
