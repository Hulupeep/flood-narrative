# Frequencies Only She Can See
*September 17, 2024 - Twenty Months After the Flood*

---

The bathroom stall door blazes with hooked letters.

Swedish maybe—those little crowns floating above the vowels. But wrong. Like someone wrote them underwater, or dying, or both. The UV paint shouldn't be visible in normal light, but the afternoon sun hits at exactly thirty-seven degrees through the narrow window, and for three minutes each day, the invisible becomes—

"You okay in there?"

Emma from orientation. Pottery major. Can't see purple when it's right in front of her.

"Fine." Chloe's hand hovers over the latch. She could open it. Point. Say *look at the door. Tell me what you see.*

Her hand drops.

BECAUSE Emma won't see it.
THEREFORE Chloe stays silent.
BUT the message pulses like it's alive.

The toilet in the next stall flushes. Footsteps approach the sinks. Safe now to emerge. Chloe opens the door, walks to the mirror, doesn't look at Emma washing clay from her fingernails—gray clay that's actually seventeen different grays if you count the ultraviolet spectrum bleeding through, but who's counting?

She is. Always counting colors that don't have names.

"Marcus wants everyone at the lagoon by four," Emma says. "Commemoration thing."

The lagoon. Where salt water reached during the flood. Where she first saw—no. Don't think about that night. Not here. Not with Emma's reflection showing zero recognition of the UV message screaming from the bathroom door.

"I have a thing."

"Come on, Chloe. I know you were here during—" Emma stops, recalculates. "Sorry..."

The words taste copper-green, like pennies dissolved in chlorine. She knows what she was about to say T for trauma.  Emma stares at the blank wall, waiting for a response. But its not blank is it? Nothing is.  Blank walls  aren't blank at all.

Emma leaves. The bathroom empties. 

Chloe turns back to the stall door.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Find me where the water began.

BECAUSE the message exists in UV frequencies
THEREFORE someone with UV paint wrote it
BUT it appeared overnight
THEREFORE someone was here recently

Her phone buzzes. Maria.

"You see my text about the new paintings?"

"What paintings?"

"In the library. Where that maintenance guy—you know. Before."

The maintenance ghost. The one nobody saw clearly. The one who painted impossible things that only—

"They're different now," Maria continues. "Like, responding to something. Thought you should know since you're doing that color perception research."

Color perception research. That's what she calls it when people ask why she photographs blank walls and arranges objects by frequencies others can't detect.

"I'll look."

"Also, there's someone else checking them out. Some tall guy with an accent. Swedish or something."

Swedish.

The bathroom door's message throbs in peripheral vision—the thirty-seven-degree angle shifting as Earth rotates, UV becoming invisible again, but burned in her tetrachromatic memory: *Find me where the water began.*

The water began at the library.

## Outside: The Shimmer

Brad from her Modernism seminar leans against a eucalyptus tree, rolling a joint. "Hey Martinez, you coming to the lagoon thing?"

The tree behind him shimmers—wrong word, but English doesn't have vocabulary for what she sees. Like heat waves but in frequencies that taste purple. The same shimmer she's been seeing for weeks, always in places where—

"Earth to Chloe."

"What?"

"The commemoration. You coming?"

She looks directly at the tree. The shimmer vanishes. Looks away—it returns, dancing in peripheral vision where her fourth cone catches frequencies that shouldn't exist.

"Can you see—" She stops. Remembers Emma's blank stare at the bathroom door. "Never mind."

BECAUSE Brad won't see the shimmer
THEREFORE she doesn't finish the question
BUT the shimmer intensifies when she's not looking

Brad shrugs, takes a hit, wanders toward the lagoon where normal people process normal trauma in normal ways.

Chloe walks the opposite direction. Toward the library. Toward where water began.

## The Library: Lower Level

The stairs still smell like flood—mineral-salt-decay that no amount of renovation can erase. Her synesthesia translates it into colors: gray-green-brown with edges of metallic yellow. The taste of disaster.

Maria waits by the new age philosophy section, her expression doing something quick—recognition?—before settling into helpful concern. "There. See?"

The wall looks blank to most people. But Chloe's tetrachromatic eyes process a hundred million colors where others see three million, and the wall—

Explodes.

UV paint in patterns that shouldn't exist. Not random. Deliberate. Responding to—

"Holy shit," she breathes.

"Right? Marisol from facilities says they've tried painting over them three times. They keep coming back. But here's the weird part—"

Maria shines a blacklight. The paintings change. Shift. Reveal layers underneath, like a palimpsest of impossible colors. And in the corner, that same hooked Swedish: *Du ser mig.*

You see me.

BECAUSE the message addresses her directly
THEREFORE someone knows she can see UV
BUT nobody knows about her tetrachromacy
THEREFORE impossible

"Someone's been adding to them," Maria continues. "At night. But security cameras show nothing. Like whoever's doing it is invisible."

Invisible. Or painting in spectrums cameras can't detect.

"When did the new ones appear?"

"Last three weeks. Since you've been back on campus."

Since she's been back. Since she started arranging things in patterns only she can see. Since she's been unconsciously responding to—

Footsteps on the stairs. Heavy. Measured. Familiar but impossible because—

He rounds the corner.

Tall. Pale. Swedish angles to his face. Paint under his fingernails—seventeen different colors including UV frequencies that scream recognition through her impossible eyes.

He stops. Sees her. His eyes—green that's actually forty-three different greens if you map the spectrum—widen.

"Chloe?"

Her name in his accent. The same voice from the tower. From eight hours of thinking they'd die. From promises made in emergency lighting while water rose.

"Hale?"

BECAUSE she recognizes him despite twenty months
THEREFORE this is really happening
BUT he's supposed to be gone/dead/lost
THEREFORE impossible moment

"You can see them," he says. Not a question. "The paintings. You've been seeing them all along."

The UV messages. The patterns. The conversation in colors without names. All him. All for her. All this time.

"You're the ghost."

"And you're the one who's been answering."

BECAUSE she's been arranging objects unconsciously
THEREFORE responding to his UV paintings
BUT neither knew the other was there
THEREFORE unconscious conversation
THEREFORE twenty months of speaking in colors
THEREFORE found each other through art

Maria looks between them. "You two know each other?"

The question hangs like UV paint—visible only from certain angles, in certain lights, to certain eyes that see beyond the visible spectrum.

"We survived the flood together," Chloe says.

"We've been looking for each other," Hale adds.

BECAUSE the flood separated them
THEREFORE twenty months of searching
BUT wrong names, no records
THEREFORE both thought the other was lost
BUT both kept creating
THEREFORE unconscious faith
THEREFORE art as beacon
THEREFORE inevitable reunion

"The water began here," Chloe says, and watches him understand—she saw his message, she came, she can see everything he's painted in frequencies that don't exist for other eyes.

"And ended in the tower," he completes.

Where everything changed. Where she learned she wasn't broken but rare. Where they kissed thinking they'd die. Where love began in disaster and survived in invisible wavelengths, waiting for the right angle of light to make it visible again.

## The Recognition

"Twenty months," she says.

"Twenty months," he echoes.

They stand ten feet apart. The space between them shimmers—that same peripheral frequency she's been seeing everywhere he's been.

"I searched—"

"I know. Me too."

"The helicopters—"

"Different buildings. Different evacuations."

"Your name—"

"They had it wrong. Lars Holstrom instead of Hale Lindqvist."

"The accusations—"

"Dropped. Derek finally admitted I never—" He stops. Looks at the wall of UV paintings. "I kept painting. For you. Even when I thought—"

"I kept arranging. Patterns. Colors. I didn't know why."

BECAUSE connection persists beyond conscious knowledge
THEREFORE art as unconscious language
BUT required reunion to understand
THEREFORE twenty months of parallel creation
THEREFORE love speaking in frequencies

Maria clears her throat. "Okay, this is intense, but also—what the hell?"

Chloe doesn't look away from Hale. Can't. His face is seventeen different temperatures and she feels every one as color—the warm zones where blood runs close to skin, the cool shadows under his eyes from months of painting at night, the specific heat of recognition.

"I have tetrachromacy," she says. To Maria but really to him. "Four color cones instead of three. I see a hundred million colors including UV spectrum."

"And I paint in UV," Hale adds. "Have been leaving messages only she could see."

"We've been having a conversation," Chloe continues. "Without knowing. For months."

"Years if you count before flood."

"When we didn't know each other existed."

"But were already speaking."

Maria's eyes widen. "Are you saying you two have been unconsciously communicating through invisible art?"

They look at each other. Twenty months of searching ending in a library that still smells like catastrophe, surrounded by UV declarations only she can see, painted by hands she thought she'd never touch again.

"Yes," they say together.

BECAUSE their connection transcends normal perception
THEREFORE found each other through impossible art
THEREFORE love persists in frequencies others can't see
THEREFORE the flood didn't end anything
BUT revealed what was always there:

Two people speaking in spectrums that don't exist for anyone else, proving that invisible doesn't mean alone.
