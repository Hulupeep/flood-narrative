# Chapter 1: The Return (Revised with Stronger Hook)
*September 2024*

The UV paint on the bathroom stall door says "Don't disappear" in Swedish, and Chloe Martinez knows it's meant for her.

She shouldn't be able to see it. No one should—not in regular light, not twenty months after the flood that destroyed most of campus, definitely not in a women's restroom that's been rebuilt twice since then. But the message shimmers against the pale blue door like a bruise only she can detect, and her hands start arranging the paper towels by color before she can stop them.

*Seventeen shades of white in industrial paper towels. Seventeen. Always seventeen since that night.*

She photographs the message with shaking hands, knowing the camera won't capture what she sees. It never does. Her phone holds hundreds of blank-looking walls that burn with invisible art, evidence of a conversation she's been having with someone who might be dead, or might be dangerous, or might be the only person who's ever actually seen her.

Outside the restroom, UC Santa Barbara thrums with September energy—freshmen dragging suitcases, returning students shrieking reunions, parents snapping photos by the lagoon that's finally been refilled. Nobody notices the woman frozen by the bathroom door, counting colors that don't exist, searching for messages in frequencies most humans can't perceive.

Twenty months ago, she spent eight hours trapped in a flooding tower with a Swedish maintenance worker who painted in UV light. Twenty months ago, she discovered she wasn't crazy—she was tetrachromatic, seeing a hundred million colors where others saw one million. Twenty months ago, they were separated by rescue helicopters and she's been searching for him ever since.

The campus looks almost the same. Almost. New eucalyptus saplings where the old giants drowned, their teenage bark too uniform, lacking the complexity the old trees had. Fresh concrete paths snake where the earth split open, their pristine gray jarring against the weathered walkways that survived. Cheerful signs about "Building Back Better" assault her eyes—something about the paint combinations makes her nauseous, like the colors are fighting each other.

She forces herself to walk. She's supposedly here to register, finally, the transfer papers in her bag already feeling like lies. But really she's here because Maria Santos called three weeks ago with four words that changed everything: "New paintings are appearing."

If Hale is alive, if he's still here, if he's been painting invisible messages for twenty months while she searched everywhere but the obvious place—

"Chloe Martinez?"

She spins. Brad Hutchinson stands there, her old SBCC counselor, but something's different. He's not wearing his usual leering smile. He looks tired, human. His eyes drop briefly to her chest—can't help himself, she thinks—then back up with something almost like shame.

"Brad? What are you doing at UCSB?"

"Transferred. After the flood, many of us did. Clean slate, you know?" He pulls out a folder. "I kept copies. Of your records. When SBCC's servers flooded, everyone lost their transcripts. Except my students."

"Why?"

"Because I knew you'd come back. The real you, not the one pretending." He pushes the folder into her hands. "Your real transcripts. Including the courses you actually attended before... before you stopped. It's enough units to transfer. Barely, but enough."

She should thank him. Should ask questions. But behind him, she's noticed something—a maintenance golf cart parked by the library, and on its side, barely visible unless you know how to look, a streak of UV paint that forms the number 2.

"That boy you were trapped with during the flood," Brad continues, not noticing her distraction. "The maintenance worker. He's been asking about you."

The world tilts. "Hale? You've seen Hale?"

"Different shift now. Days. But yeah, he's around. Painting weird stuff only certain people can see. Thought you should know."

Brad walks away, leaving Chloe holding her future in a manila folder while her eyes track that golf cart, that number 2, that evidence he's here, he's real, he's been waiting.

She follows the cart's tire tracks, finding more UV marks—arrows, numbers, fragments of Swedish she's learned to read through months of desperate Google Translate sessions. They lead toward the library, toward the third floor, toward a corner where she used to arrange pencils in patterns that made sense only to her.

The bread crumbs are fresh. Some still tacky to the touch.

He's here. Right now. Somewhere close.

Her phone buzzes. Unknown number. She almost doesn't answer, but something—the seventeen different shades of heat shimmering on her phone case—makes her accept.

Breathing. Then his voice, unchanged, accented, careful: "You can see them."

Not a question.

"I've always seen them," she says. "Even when I couldn't see them, I was seeing them. My whole body was responding to paintings I didn't know existed."

"I know. I have photos of every arrangement you ever made. They match my paintings from the night before. Every time."

Her throat closes. "Where are you?"

"Look up."

She does. In the library window, third floor, northwest corner—their spot—a figure stands backlit by afternoon sun. She can't see his face, but she can see his hands pressed against the glass, and she knows those hands. Seventeen different warms. She's been searching for those specific warms for twenty months.

"Don't disappear," he says into the phone, echoing the bathroom message.

"Never again," she promises.

She runs.

Behind her, the campus continues its September rituals, oblivious to the woman sprinting toward a reunion twenty months in the making, following invisible paint toward visible love, carrying transcripts for a future she's not sure she needs anymore because the only education she really wants is learning to translate impossible colors with someone who paints in frequencies only she can see.

The UV messages get denser as she climbs the stairs—not just arrows now but words, phrases, entire sentences in Swedish and English and the visual language they've been developing without knowing it. The walls are covered in twenty months of waiting, hoping, believing she'd come back.

By the time she reaches the third floor, she's crying. Not from sadness but from recognition—the overwhelming relief of being seen, really seen, by someone who never stopped looking even when she was invisible.

The door to their corner is open.

He's there.

Real.

Waiting.

Painting.
