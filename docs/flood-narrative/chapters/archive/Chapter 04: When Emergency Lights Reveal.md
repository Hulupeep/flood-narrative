# When Emergency Lights Reveal

The lights die.

No flicker. No warning. Just sudden black so complete she tastes it—burnt copper and snow.

Someone screams downstairs. Water sounds. Getting closer.

Then—

Emergency lighting kicks in. UV-tinged. Battery-powered. And the world explodes.


The walls blaze with paint that shouldn't exist. Hooked letters, spiraling patterns, colors that scream frequencies her brain translates as taste—midnight-blue that floods her mouth with salt, arctic-silver that numbs her tongue, poison-yellow that makes her gag.

"What the—"

She stumbles backward. Her spine hits the wall—it's wet. Not water-wet. Paint-wet. Fresh.


In the doorway: a silhouette.

Tall. Familiar. Holding something that glows.

"You see them."


Not a question. That accent—Swedish, careful, like testing if words still work after months of silence. The maintenance ghost. Real. Here. Watching her see his invisible gallery.


"The paintings," she manages. "They're—everywhere."

"UV paint." He steps forward. Emergency light catches his face—sharp bones, pale eyes reflecting frequencies that shouldn't exist. "Only visible under blacklight or—" He gestures at the emergency lighting. "These specific wavelengths."


A student runs past the doorway, flashlight swinging. The beam illuminates the walls—nothing. Just beige paint. The student doesn't slow.

But when the emergency light returns, the paintings blaze back. 

Only for her.

"How many colors?" His voice cracks on colors.


She counts without meaning to—her brain categorizing frequencies like filing music. "Fifty-three distinct shades in that section. Maybe more. They keep—" The colors shift, pulse, breathe. "They're moving."

He sets down what he's holding—a UV pen. His hand shakes.

"Most people see one. Maybe two if the light's right."


"Four cones," he says quietly. "Instead of three. You have four color cones."


Four cones. Like she's some kind of evolution. Like she's broken. Like she's—wait. He knows. He KNOWS.

"How do you—"

"I researched it. After—" He stops. Looks at the walls covered in months of work. "After I realized you were responding."


The patterns. Oh god, the patterns. That spiral in the corner—it matches her pencil arrangement from October. That burst of gold-silver-pearl mirrors her Instagram post from November. Every painting is a response to something she created.

"You've been watching me."


"You've been answering." His accent thickens with emotion. "Every pattern you made matched paintings I'd done the night before. We were having conversation, Chloe."

Her name. He knows her name.


"Does anyone else—can anyone else see—"

He shakes his head. "Tested it. Other people, UV lights, cameras." He pulls out his phone, shows her photos. "Look."

Through the camera: blank walls.
Through her eyes: a gallery of impossible beauty.

"Just me?"

"Just you."


The building shudders.

Water. Closer.

Rising.


"We need to go." He grabs her hand—seventeen different temperatures register simultaneously, her synesthesia exploding into combinations that shouldn't exist. "Tower. Highest ground."


Seventeen warms. She's felt them before—in library books he's touched, bench arms where he's rested, walls he's painted. His specific heat signature invisible to everyone but her tetrachromatic nervous system that processes temperature as color as sound as—

"You're real," she says, stupid with recognition.

"So are you. You're the ghost I've been painting for."


They run through hallways lit by emergency strobes. With each flash, more paintings reveal themselves—messages in Swedish, English, languages that exist only in color. Her whole body responds, arranging itself to match frequencies only she can perceive.


They pass other students fleeing. 

"The walls!" Chloe shouts. "Look at the walls!"

No one looks. Or they look and see nothing. Their eyes slide past miracles, focused only on escape.

She's alone in this vision.

No—


"I painted them for you," Hale says, pulling her up the stairwell. "Only for you. I didn't know who you were, but I knew you were seeing them. Responding. The only person who could."


Tetrachromatic. Four cones. UV perception. Twenty years of being wrong suddenly reorganizing into being rare. Being special. Being exactly who she needs to be to see what he's been painting in frequencies nobody else can perceive.


Water crashes through the first floor.

They climb.

She sees everything now—how UV paint reveals itself in emergency light, how her tetrachromacy isn't illness but gift, how they've been building something together without knowing, how the flood isn't ending but beginning.

"There," he points to a door. "Carillon room. Highest point."



She turns for one last look as they reach the door. The stairwell is a cathedral of invisible art, every surface covered in frequencies only she can see. But more than that—she can see the conversation they've been having. Call and response. Pattern and echo. Two people speaking in colors that don't have names.

"After this," she says as he opens the door. "After we don't die. Will I still see them?"

"Only if you know where to look." He pulls something from his pocket—a small UV flashlight. "Or if you have this."

She takes it. Their fingers touch—seventeen warms, always seventeen—and her synesthesia translates his touch into colors that taste like safety in a drowning world.

They enter the carillon room where they'll spend eight hours learning that everything they thought was invisible was actually love becoming visible one UV painting at a time, one tetrachromatic response at a moment, one perfect disaster forcing two people who speak in impossible frequencies to finally hear each other.

The door closes.

The water rises.

The conversation continues.
