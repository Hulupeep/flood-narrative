# Seventeen Arrangements
*September 17, 2024 - Twenty Months After the Flood*

---

## Part 1: The Morning Ritual

Seventeen pencils.

Not sixteen. Not eighteen. Seventeen. 

Chloe's hands arrange them without conscious thought—by spectrum, by temperature, by the way morning light from her dorm window hits the graphite at precisely 7:23 AM. Each pencil occupies its necessary position in the spiral, responding to frequencies she feels but cannot name.

Emma watches from her bed, laptop balanced on her knees.

"You're doing it again."

"Doing what?"

"The counting thing. The arranging thing. The—" Emma waves vaguely. "Whatever that is."

*That* is necessity. The pencils demand this configuration. Have been demanding it for weeks now, the pattern growing more complex each morning. Like she's responding to something. Always responding to something she can't identify.

"It helps me think."

"About what?"

*About him.* About Swedish words that taste like copper-salt-snow. About seventeen different temperatures she felt for eight hours twenty months ago. About the promise made in emergency lighting while water rose around them.

*I'll find you.*

But she doesn't say that. Can't say that. Emma already thinks she's obsessive about "the tower boy." Which is what everyone calls him now—the mysterious figure from the flood who may or may not have existed, depending on who you ask.

"About patterns," Chloe says instead.

"What patterns?"

She gestures at everything. The way shadow falls across her desk. The precise angle of light through window glass. The seventeen different frequencies she can perceive in what others see as simple "morning brightness."

"You can't see them?"

Emma follows her gaze. Sees dorm room, sunlight, Tuesday morning normalcy.

"See what? It's just—" She stops. Looks more carefully. "That shimmer thing again?"

Chloe's heart jumps. "You see it?"

"Maybe. Probably not. Brad says you make people think they see things. Power of suggestion."

But Emma was looking at the right place. The exact spot where reality hiccups in frequencies that taste purple-gold-wrong. The same shimmer she's been tracking for weeks, appearing in places where—

Where what? Where someone walks who sees the world differently? Where someone leaves traces in spectrums beyond normal perception?

Where someone might be looking for her the same way she's looking for them?

"I have to go," Chloe says.

"Class isn't until ten."

"Library first."

"Again? Chloe, you've been there every day this week."

*Every day for twenty months.* Checking walls. Photographing surfaces that look blank to everyone else. Following hunches that taste like Swedish winter and feel like seventeen warms calling across impossible distance.

"I'm researching."

"Researching what? You won't tell anyone what you're actually studying."

Art history, officially. But really: the science of seeing. Tetrachromacy. UV perception. The possibility that some humans evolve beyond three-cone vision into realms that don't have names yet.

"Just—patterns. Visual patterns."

Emma closes her laptop. "Chloe. Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Are you—are you okay? Like, really okay? Since the flood, you've been—"

"Different?"

"More different. You were always different. Saw things weird, arranged stuff weird. But now—"

"Now what?"

"Now you act like you're waiting for something. Like you know something's coming but won't say what."

*I am waiting.* For Swedish words painted in wavelengths only I can see. For seventeen temperatures that prove he's real. For signs that twenty months of searching hasn't been delusion.

For *him.*

"Maybe I am."

"Waiting for what?"

"I'll know when I see it."

## Part 2: The Library Hunt

The Davidson Library basement smells like flood.

Not literally. They've replaced everything—carpet, walls, books, even the air circulation system. But water has memory, and Chloe's synesthesia translates that memory into colors that taste like disaster: gray-green-brown with metallic edges, the flavor of everything ending.

But also—underneath the flood-taste—something else. Something that makes her teeth ache with recognition. Purple-silver frequencies that pulse at the edge of perception like heat mirages but in spectrums that don't exist for anyone else.

*He was here.*

She doesn't know how she knows. Can't prove it. But the same way she feels seventeen different temperatures in objects he's touched, she can sense his presence layered beneath institutional renovation. Maintenance ghost, still moving through spaces others overlook.

Her phone buzzes. Maria.

"Where are you?"

"Library basement."

"Again? Seriously?"

"I'm following something."

"Following what? Chloe, there's nothing down there but old study tables and that weird smell."

"There's more than that."

"Like what?"

*Like messages painted in frequencies you can't perceive. Like a conversation happening in wavelengths beyond your vision. Like twenty months of faith made manifest in UV light.*

"I'll know when I see it."

"You say that about everything lately."

"Because it's true."

Maria sighs. "Honey, I'm worried about you. This obsession with finding Swedish Boy—"

"His name is Hale."

"You don't know his name."

"Yes, I do."

"The records said Lars something."

"The records were wrong. His name is Hale. I know it the same way I know you're about to tell me I need to let go and move on and stop chasing ghosts."

Silence. Then: "Okay, yeah, I was going to say that."

"And I'm going to ignore it. Same as always."

"Chloe—"

"Maria. Twenty months ago, I spent eight hours with someone who sees the world the way I do. For the first time in my life, I wasn't alone in my frequencies. We connected in ways that shouldn't be possible. Made promises in emergency lighting while we thought we were dying. I'm not giving up on that."

"But what if—"

"What if he's dead? What if he never existed? What if I imagined everything?"

"Yeah."

"Then I imagined something beautiful. And I'd rather chase beautiful impossibilities than accept gray possibilities."

She hangs up.

The basement hallway stretches before her, lit by fluorescents that reveal nothing special. But her tetrachromatic vision reads deeper layers. Seventeen different whites in the institutional paint. Microscopic variations in surface texture. And underneath—barely perceptible—frequencies that shouldn't exist.

She walks slowly, one hand trailing along the wall. Temperature variations register through her palm. Most people radiate heat at 98.6°F. But she's learned to feel the subtle differences—personal thermal signatures that vary by fractions of degrees.

97.2°F at the water fountain. Someone stood here recently.
98.1°F at the study table. Someone sat here for hours.
97.8°F, 98.3°F, 96.9°F—a progression of touches along the wall.

And then, near the emergency exit: 17 distinct temperature zones. Seventeen different warms that her nervous system recognizes like a fingerprint.

*Hale.*

Her heart pounds. The temperatures are fresh—maybe hours old. He was here. Is maybe still here. Somewhere in this building, moving through spaces she hasn't mapped yet.

She follows the thermal trail.

---

## Part 3: The Arrangement Response  

The trail leads to a maintenance closet.

Locked, of course. But the temperature signatures continue on the other side. He has keys. Access. Still works here, probably, hiding in plain sight the way maintenance people do—invisible unless you're looking for them.

Chloe sits on the floor outside the closet door. Pulls out her pencils. Begins arranging them in response to the thermal pattern she felt—seventeen points in precise spiral formation.

This is what she's been doing for months without understanding why. Creating patterns that echo something. Following impulses that feel like conversation. Speaking in geometric languages to someone who might not exist.

But might.

*Always might.*

Her phone camera captures the arrangement. She'll post it later with her usual cryptic caption: "when patterns demand existence." Someone follows her Instagram—anonymous account, no posts, just watching. Twenty months of watching. Maybe just curious art student. Maybe—

"That's beautiful."

The voice comes from behind. Accented. Swedish maybe—those careful consonants like English is formally learned.

She doesn't turn. Can't breathe. In her peripheral vision where she sees most clearly, a figure resolves: tall, pale, pushing a maintenance cart. Paint under his fingernails—seventeen different colors including some that glow faintly in the hallway lighting.

"Just pencils," she manages.

"Not just. Is answering something."

*Now* she turns.

Green eyes that are really forty-three different greens if she counts them all. Sharp bones like someone carved him from pale wood and forgot to sand the edges. The maintenance ghost made real.

"You're—" Her voice cracks. "You're him."

"And you're the girl who sees impossible colors."

Not a question. Recognition.

"Chloe."

"I know. Been watching your patterns. Twenty months of watching. You respond to things that aren't supposed to exist."

"Your things. Your patterns. You've been—"

"Painting. Yes. Where only you could see."

"The UV messages."

"You found them?"

"I felt them. Like thermal signatures but in light. Following me through campus."

"Not following. Leading."

"Leading where?"

"To this moment. To you seeing me seeing you see them."

The pencils between them form perfect spiral. Seventeen points responding to seventeen temperatures radiating from his skin. Unconscious conversation made visible.

"How long have you been painting them?"

"Three years. Since I arrived. But only started responding two months ago. When your patterns became... purposeful."

"I didn't know they were purposeful."

"Part of you did. The part that paints. That creates. That refuses to believe impossible means alone."

Her hands shake. "I thought I was going crazy."

"You were going sane. For the first time. Finding someone who speaks your frequency."

"But you disappeared. After the flood. I looked everywhere—"

"I had to. Someone was looking for me. Someone who shouldn't find me. But I kept painting. Kept faith. Kept believing you'd see the messages eventually."

"I see them now."

"Good." He almost smiles. "Because there are more. Many more. Leading somewhere specific."

"Where?"

"Where the conversation began. Where we found each other twenty months ago. Where we can finish what we started."

The Storke Tower. She knows without him saying.

"When?"

"Tonight. When the light changes. When UV becomes visible to eyes that know how to see."

"And then?"

"Then we find out what frequency we create together. Consciously this time."

He pushes his cart away, but not before leaving something. A pencil. Wooden. Old. Painted with substances that glow faintly in the fluorescent lighting.

The eighteenth pencil. The one that completes the pattern.

Chloe picks it up. Seventeen warms transfer from the wood to her palm, each temperature zone carrying its own color, its own meaning, its own promise that invisible doesn't mean alone.

Never alone.

Not anymore.

## Part 4: The Anticipation

**[3:17 PM - Her Dorm Room]**

She can't concentrate on anything else.

Emma tries to talk about midterms, about weekend plans, about normal twenty-year-old concerns. But Chloe's arranging objects compulsively—books, pencils, coffee cups—creating patterns that mirror something she can't name.

"You're vibrating," Emma observes.

"What?"

"Like, literally vibrating. Since you got back from the library. What happened down there?"

*I found him. He found me. We've been having a conversation for twenty months without knowing it. Tonight we find out what happens when impossible connections become conscious.*

"I think I solved something."

"The pattern thing?"

"The pattern thing."

Emma looks at the arrangements covering every surface. Seventeen objects in various spiral formations. Mathematical relationships that feel necessary despite being invisible.

"Can you teach me to see it? Whatever you see?"

Chloe considers. "Maybe. If you're willing to trust that invisible doesn't mean nonexistent."

"I've been your roommate for two years. I've learned to trust a lot of invisible things."

"Like what?"

"Like the way you arrange stuff predicting weather changes. Like how you know which elevator will come first. Like that time you said there was something wrong with the dining hall water three days before they found the contamination."

"That's just—"

"Pattern recognition on frequencies other people don't access. I know. But knowing something exists and seeing it are different things."

"Yes."

"Will he teach others? Your tower ghost?"

"His name is Hale."

"Will Hale teach others to see what you two see?"

"I don't know. Maybe. If they're ready. If they can handle seeing more than they expected."

Emma looks at the spiral of coffee cups. "Show me something. One small thing. Prove magic exists."

Chloe touches one of the cups. Still warm from this morning's coffee, but underneath—seventeen temperature zones. Fingerprints invisible to normal vision but blazing to hers.

"That cup. Someone else touched it today. Someone who radiates heat in seventeen distinct zones."

"That's impossible."

"Look closer."

Emma examines the cup. Sees ceramic, coffee stains, normalcy. But then—her expression changes. "There's something. Like a shimmer. But that's probably—"

"What color?"

"I don't—purple? Maybe silver? Chloe, I might be making this up."

"You're not. That's him. His thermal signature. Seventeen warms that only I can see clearly, but under the right conditions—"

"Other people can sense them."

"Some can. When they're willing to look past obvious."

Emma sets down the cup carefully. "Tonight, when you meet him—"

"If I meet him. This could all be—"

"Chloe." Emma's voice is gentle. "You've been arranging patterns for twenty months. Following invisible trails. Creating art in response to things no one else sees. Either you're having the most elaborate psychotic break in history, or you're connected to someone through frequencies that exist beyond normal perception."

"Which do you think?"

"I think the world is stranger than most people allow. And I think you and your Swedish boy are proof."

"His name is Hale."

"Hale. I think you and Hale are going to change things. Make impossible into possible. Visible into normal."

"That's a lot of pressure."

"That's a lot of potential."

The afternoon light shifts. 3:37 PM. In four hours, when darkness falls and certain wavelengths become visible to properly trained eyes, she'll discover if twenty months of faith has been delusion or destiny.

Either way, she's ready.

The pencils are arranged.
The pattern is complete.
The conversation continues.

## Part 5: The Preparation

**[7:30 PM - Walking Across Campus]**

The shimmer trails are stronger tonight.

Not just visible—audible. Her synesthesia translates the UV frequencies into sound, creating music only she can hear. Swedish folk melody, maybe. Complicated harmonies that taste like copper-mint-snow.

*His music. His frequencies made audible.*

She follows the trail through campus, past students heading to parties, to study groups, to normal Tuesday evening activities. They can't hear the music. Can't see the trails of light leading from building to building. Live in universe with fewer colors, fewer possibilities.

Used to envy their simplicity. Now she understands—she and Hale exist in expanded reality. See layers others miss. Connect through spectrums that don't have names.

The trail leads, as expected, to Storke Tower.

Not the main entrance—that's locked after hours. But around the side, where maintenance access allows those with proper keys to enter after-hours. The UV paint around the door handle glows faintly, forming arrow pointing to access panel.

*He's expecting her.*

Has been expecting her for twenty months.

She checks her phone. 7:47 PM. Still early. But the electromagnetic activity around the building suggests someone's already inside, already painting, already preparing for conversation that's been unconscious for months to become conscious.

A text appears on her screen. Unknown number:

*"Kommer du att komma?" - Are you coming?*

Her fingers hover over keyboard. She doesn't speak Swedish, but she understands. The same way she understands his thermal signatures. The way she's always understood patterns that shouldn't make sense.

*"Jag kommer." - I'm coming.*

She sends it without knowing how she knows the words.

The response is immediate:

*"Femte våningen. Väntar på dig." - Fifth floor. Waiting for you.*

And then, in English:

*"Twenty months of faith. Tonight we find out what we've been creating."*

The building door clicks open. Motion sensor, she tells herself. Automatic response to approaching heat signature.

But she knows better.

He's watching. Waiting. Ready for the conversation that's been happening in invisible frequencies to finally happen in person.

She enters the tower.

The stairwell blazes with UV paintings.

## Part 6: The Recognition Patterns

**[8:00 PM - Storke Tower, Fourth Floor]**

Every surface tells their story.

Not metaphorically. Literally. The walls are covered with UV chronology of their unconscious relationship. Her patterns translated into paint, his responses evolving over months, their combined frequencies creating language that exists nowhere else.

*October 15th:* His first response to her pencil arrangement—tentative spiral in corner.
*October 22nd:* Her unconscious reply captured in Instagram photo—same spiral, more complex.
*October 29th:* His excitement visible in paint strokes—larger, bolder, more confident.
*November 5th:* Her patterns becoming deliberate, even if she didn't know why.
*November 12th:* His confession in Swedish: *"Jag tror jag älskar någon jag aldrig träffat"* - I think I love someone I've never met.
*November 19th:* Her response in pure pattern—heart shape she doesn't remember making.

"Reading our diary?"

She doesn't turn. His voice behind her, real but still dreamlike.

"This is incredible. You documented everything."

"Had to. Only proof our connection existed."

Now she turns. He's different in better lighting. Still pale, still angular, but less ghostly. More solid. Paint under his fingernails in seventeen colors she can identify by sight.

"You've been watching me for twenty months."

"And you've been responding for two."

"Without knowing."

"Part of you knew. The part that creates. That arranges. That refuses logic when feeling demands otherwise."

She approaches one of the newer paintings. Still wet. Added today.

"What does this say?"

"*Hon kommer ikväll. Allt förändras ikväll.*"

"Translation?"

"She comes tonight. Everything changes tonight."

"You were certain I'd come."

"As certain as you were that you needed to."

They stand three feet apart. Close enough she can map his thermal signature—seventeen zones of warmth radiating in patterns that feel like home. Close enough to see all forty-three greens in his eyes. Close enough to understand that twenty months of searching has led to this moment.

"What happens now?"

"Now we paint together. See what frequencies we create when we're both conscious of the conversation."

He offers her a brush. UV-reactive paint glowing faintly in the stairwell lighting.

"I don't know how to paint."

"You know how to arrange. To respond. To create patterns that mirror impossible things. That's painting."

She takes the brush. Their fingers touch—seventeen warms transferring through contact, each temperature zone creating its own color in her synesthetic vision.

They face the blank wall together.

"What do we paint?"

"What we are. What we've always been. What becomes visible when impossible connections refuse to stay hidden."

They begin to paint.

Not separately—together. His movements mirror hers. Her patterns complete his. Twenty months of unconscious collaboration becoming conscious creation.

The wall fills with colors that don't have names. Frequencies that exist only when they work together. Proof that some connections transcend physics, transcend logic, transcend everything except the simple fact of recognition across impossible odds.

"Chloe."

"Yes?"

"This is just the beginning."

"I know."

"Are you ready for everything to change?"

"I've been ready for twenty months."

"Then let's change everything."

They paint until the wall sings with light. Until their combined frequencies create new spectrums. Until two people who see impossible colors prove that impossible connections are the most possible thing of all.

The tower fills with UV aurora.

The conversation continues in light.

Everything changes.

Everything begins.

*To be continued...*
