# Water Rising
*January 9, 2023, 9:47 PM - Storke Tower*

---

Water sounds different when it's hunting you.

Not the gentle lap of ocean on sand. Not the musical trickle of fountains. This water growls—deep frequency that Chloe's synesthesia translates into the color of endings: black-brown-silver with edges that taste like rust.

"Still rising." Hale's voice from the window. Accent thicker when stressed—Swedish consonants sharpening like ice, articles dropping. "Water at third step now."

Third step of the tower stairs. Five steps total before water reaches their level. Before the only room higher than flood becomes another kind of coffin.

The emergency lights paint everything in UV frequencies that make her tetrachromatic eyes scream. Every surface blazes with his hidden paintings—months of invisible messages suddenly visible, a gallery of devotion no one else could see.

"How long do we have?"

He turns from the window. In UV light, his skin looks transparent—she can see veins like rivers, pulse points throbbing purple-blue, the specific geography of his fear.

"Two hours. Maybe three if rising slows."


"We should try the roof—"

"Padlocked. Already checked."

"The windows—"

"Sealed. Plexiglass. Would need tools we don't have."

Each elimination tastes more bitter. Options narrowing like the flood itself—inexorable, patient, final.

She sits on the floor. The wood is cold through her soaked jeans—seventeen different temperatures that her body catalogues automatically. Always seventeen with him. Their number.

"So we wait."

"We wait."

## Hour One: Establishing Rules

He sits across from her, back against the opposite wall. Ten feet that might as well be ten miles or ten inches—distance doesn't work normally in crisis.

"Tell me what you see," he says.

Strange request when death circles. But she looks around the room, lets her tetrachromatic vision unfold:

"Fifty-three distinct UV shades on the north wall. The painting there—it's responding to my breathing. When I inhale, the blue-silver intensifies. When I exhale, it shifts toward pearl-green."

"I painted it October third. Two AM. After you'd arranged those pencils in gradient outside lecture hall."

October third. Three months before the flood. Before they'd ever spoken.

"You were watching me."

"You were arranging things in patterns that matched my paintings. Thought I was going insane."


"The shimmer," she says suddenly. "I've been seeing shimmer around places you've been."

"Shimmer?"

"Like heat waves but in UV spectrum. Your... residue. Body heat in frequencies others can't see."

He shifts, and she tracks the movement through seventeen different thermal signatures—knee registers different than thigh, hand different than wrist, each zone its own specific warmth her brain assigns colors that don't have names.

"What else you see?"

"Fear," she says. "Your fear looks purple-gray. Like storm clouds made of static."

"You see emotions?"

"In you, yes. Your emotions have colors. Specific frequencies. You're the only person who—" She stops. Too intimate. Too raw.

"Who what?"

"Who exists in as many dimensions as I can perceive."

## Hour Two: Truth Exchange

Water at the second step. Sound changes—less growl, more gulp. Swallowing the building.

"I need tell you something," he says.

"Another confession?"

"Many confessions. We have—" He checks his phone. "Two hours maybe. Should say everything."

Everything. The word hangs between them like UV paint—visible only from certain angles.

"You first," she says.

"The accusation. About extremist group." His hands find a pencil on the floor, start turning it. She counts rotations—seventeen before he speaks again. "Was never true. But made me convenient target."

"Why?"

"Because I was already invisible. Foreign student. No friends. Painted at night when no one around. Perfect ghost to blame."

"But Derek—"

"Derek was protecting someone. James Holbrook. You know him?"

Holbrook. Trust fund kid. Father owns galleries. The kind who buys authenticity because he can't create it.

"He was the real—?"

"Mm. But his father donates millions. So they needed someone else to blame. And I was—" He shrugs. "Convenient ghost."


"That's why you painted in UV. Where no one could see."

"Only safe place to exist. Invisible frequencies. Until—"

"Until I could see them."

He looks at her across the shrinking space—water rising means world contracting, everything pressing closer.

"Your turn," he says. "Tell me something true."

She counts her breaths—seventeen, always seventeen—before answering.

"I've never told anyone I'm tetrachromatic. Not officially. Not doctors or family or friends."

"Why?"

"Because—" The words taste copper-bitter. "My mother had breakdown when I was seven. Saw things that weren't there. Heard colors. Felt sounds. They hospitalized her for three months."

"Synesthesia isn't mental illness."

"Try explaining that to kid watching her mother get medicated into numbness. I learned to hide what I saw. Pretend normal vision. But it's exhausting. Like speaking foreign language every moment."

"Is why you stayed on campus during break?"

"Fewer people to pretend for."

## Hour Three: Surface and Underneath


"If helicopters come—" he starts.

"When. When helicopters come."

"When. We stay together. No separation."

"Agreed. Same evacuation vehicle."

"Same hospital if needed."

"Same everything."

The word 'everything' operates on both tracks—practical planning and emotional promise.

"Tell me your full name," she says. "Real name. So I can find you if—"

"Hale Marcus Lindqvist. Born Uppsala. February nineteen, 1999."

"Chloe Elena Martinez. Santa Barbara. August seven, 1999."

They trade information like survivors should—addresses, phone numbers, emergency contacts. But underneath, they're trading promises: *I will find you. I will remember. This is real.*

"What we do after?" he asks.

Surface meaning: After rescue.
Underneath meaning: After we admit what's happening between us.

"Make art," she says, operating on both levels. "Together. Show people what we can see."

"The invisible frequencies."

"All of them."

## Hour Four: Failed Witness Test

Hale's phone rings—impossible miracle of signal in storm.

"Hello? Yes, we're in Carillon Tower. Two people. Water at—" He checks. "First step below our level."

Chloe hears tinny voice: "Help is coming. Can you signal your position?"

"How?"

"Light, sound, anything visible—"

Visible. The word cuts. Their whole world blazes with UV messages only she can see. Invisible to rescuers.

"Wait," she says. Takes phone. "The UV paintings. If you have blacklight equipment—"

"Ma'am, we need visible signals."

"These ARE visible. UV spectrum. The whole tower is covered in—"

"Ma'am, please remain calm. Hallucinations are common in crisis—"

She hangs up.


"They think I'm crazy."

"You're not crazy. You see what exists."

"But if they can't see it—"

"Then we make our own signal."

He stands, pulls out UV pen from his pocket. Starts writing on the window—backwards so it reads correctly from outside, but she realizes he's writing in Swedish and English simultaneously, the words overlapping into pattern that makes her synesthesia explode:

HJÄLP = HELP

The letters shimmer between languages, between visible and invisible, between plea and art.

"They still won't see—"

"You see it. That's enough."

## Hour Five: The Truth Underneath

Water touches their floor. Just dampness at doorway edge, but promise of more.

They move to center of room. Closer now. Close enough she can map his heat signature without trying—seventeen warms radiating like personal aurora.

"I should tell you—" she starts.

"What?"

"That night in October. When you painted the spiral pattern. I was in the library. Arranging study guides by color. And I felt—" She stops. How to explain feeling someone's painting from across campus?

"Felt what?"

"Pull. Like gravity but sideways. Drew me to window. And I saw you—tiny figure crossing quad at 2 AM. Couldn't see details. But I knew—*knew*—you were going to create something. So I arranged my guides to match what I felt you painting."

"October third?"

"October third."

His breath catches—she hears it as color, blue-white like frozen oxygen.

"That's night I realized someone was responding. Saw your arrangement next morning. Perfect match to painting no one could see."


"We were talking before we knew we existed," she says.

"No. We knew. Just didn't have words for it."

## Hour Six: Water and Want


Water. Ankle deep. Cold that transcends temperature.

They stand now. Where else to go?

His hand finds hers—seventeen different temperatures converging into single point of contact.

"Chloe."

"Don't."

"If we—"

"We won't."

"But if—"

She turns to face him. In UV emergency light, with water rising, with nowhere to run, with truth stripped to bone—he's beautiful. Not surface beautiful. Beautiful in frequencies others can't perceive. Like he exists in more dimensions than physics allows.

"What would you say?" she asks. "If this is ending?"

He pulls her closer. She comes. Water at their calves now, but his heat signature overwhelms cold—seventeen becoming seventy becoming seven hundred points of warmth her body catalogs as home.

"Would say I painted thousand invisible messages hoping someone someday might see one."

"And?"

"You saw all of them."

"What else?"

"That I've been looking for you my whole life without knowing what I was looking for."

"Hale—"

"Your turn. What would you say?"

The water rises. Time compresses. Truth becomes only currency worth spending.

"That you make my impossible vision feel like gift instead of curse."

"More."

"That I see infinity when I look at you. Literal infinity. Color fractals that don't end."

"More."

"That if this is how we die, at least we die seen. Really seen. For first time in our lives."

He kisses her.

Not desperate. Not frantic. Slow. Like they have forever instead of minutes. Like water isn't rising. Like the world isn't ending.

She sees colors behind closed eyes—not metaphor but literal synesthetic explosion. The kiss creates its own spectrum: gold-silver-pearl with edges of UV she has no name for. Tastes like electricity and snow. Sounds like symphony written in frequencies only she can hear.

When they part, she's crying. But the tears taste sweet—relief mixed with recognition mixed with something that might be love if love can bloom in disaster.

"Look," he says.

She turns.

The water has stopped rising.

## Hour Seven: Revelation

Still knee-deep. Still trapped. But not actively drowning.

They sit on the desk—highest furniture, furthest from water. She's in his arms now, propriety drowned with everything else. His body against hers creates seventeen different pressure points she experiences as color—amber where his chest meets her back, silver where his arms cross her waist, pearl where his breath stirs her hair.

"Tell me about the paintings," she says.

So he does. Every one. When he painted it. Why. What he saw in her arrangements that sparked response. Months of one-sided conversation he maintained on faith alone.

"This one—" He points to spiral on east wall. "After you arranged those leaves by library. Saw you counting something. Lips moving. Numbers maybe?"

"Colors. I was counting colors. Ninety-three distinct shades in fallen leaves."

"Ninety-three." He laughs—sound that looks golden in her peripheral vision. "Our number now."

"We have numbers?"

"Seventeen for warms. Ninety-three for catastrophe. What else?"

She thinks. "Four hundred ninety-seven."

"Random."

"Not random. Number of UV paintings you've made. I counted while we waited."

"You counted all—?"

"I count everything. Compulsion. Part of tetrachromacy maybe. Need to catalog what I see or it overwhelms."

"What number am I?"

Strange question. But she knows immediately:

"Infinite. You're only person I can't reduce to number. Every time I look, you're more. Different frequencies. New dimensions. Like counting stars while universe expands."

---

## Hour Eight: Future Tense


Voices outside. Helicopters. Real this time.

"When we get down—" she starts.

"Together. We agreed."

"Yes, but after. After hospital. After questioning. After—"

"We make art. Like you said."

"What kind?"

"Kind only we can make. UV and tetrachromacy. Invisible made visible."

"No one will understand."

"Don't need everyone. Just need each other."

"Is that enough?"

He turns her face toward his. In fading emergency light—batteries dying as rescue nears—she sees him in spectrums that shouldn't exist. Sees the boy who painted alone for months hoping. Sees the man who found her in flood. Sees the artist who speaks her impossible language.

"You tell me," he says. "Is it enough?"

The ladder hits the window. Rescue. Salvation. Separation maybe, despite promises.

"It's everything," she says.

And means it in every frequency.
