# Chapter 7: The Conversation
*January 10, 2023 - Midnight*

The emergency lights have been flickering for an hour. Each time they die, the room plunges into complete darkness for three seconds before buzzing back. In those three seconds, Chloe sees colors that only exist in absence—the phosphorescent afterglow of disaster, seventeen shades of black that aren't black but the memory of light.

They've moved closer without discussing it. Now they sit side by side against the east wall, shoulders not quite touching, watching water claim the seventh floor through the window. The campus is gone. In its place, an ocean that shouldn't exist, lit by lightning and the occasional explosion of transformers dying in sequence.

"Tell me about the colors," Hale says.

"Which ones?"

"The ones you see that I can't."

She looks at the water—black to most eyes, but to her: "Thirty-seven different grays, each with undertones. Purple-gray where it's deepest. Green-gray where algae is already forming. Silver-gray where oil floats. And underneath, colors that don't have names because no one else has needed to name them."

"Make names."

"What?"

"You're the only one who sees them. You get to name them."

She's never thought of it that way—having the authority to name what only she perceives. "The color of the water where it meets the building—that specific brown-gold-black—I'll call it 'aftermath.' The color of the emergency lights reflected in the flood—that's 'please.' The color of the sky right now, that purple-green-nothing—that's 'between.'"

"Between?"

"Between safety and drowning. Between lying and truth. Between us being strangers and... whatever we are now."

"What are we now?"

She turns to look at him. His profile in the stuttering emergency light is sharp, tired, beautiful. "I don't know. What do you call two people who've been talking without words for months?"

"In Swedish, there's a word—'själsfrände.' Soul friend. Someone who understands your frequency."

"Is that what we are?"

"I painted for you before I knew you existed. You arranged colors in response to paintings you couldn't consciously see. We're something."

The lights die again. Three seconds of black. In the darkness, she feels him shift, his shoulder finally touching hers. The contact is electric—not romantic, not yet, but essential. A circuit completing.

When the lights return, she sees he's pulled something from his pocket. A small notebook, weathered, covered in what looks like random marks but what she recognizes as a color code.

"I documented them," he says. "Your arrangements. Every pattern you made, I sketched, tried to understand. Look—"

He flips through pages. Her pencil arrangements, her color choices, dated and timed. September 15th: seafoam to midnight in twenty-three steps. October 2nd: spiral pattern, reds she'd never seen before. November 11th: the rainbow that wasn't a rainbow but a cry for help in forty-seven shades.

"You were watching me that closely?"

"I was trying to understand the language. You were speaking in color, and I only had UV paint to respond. We were using different vocabularies for the same conversation."

"What were we saying?"

He closes the notebook. "That we're lonely. That we see things others don't. That being invisible doesn't mean we don't exist. That sometimes the most beautiful things are the ones no one else notices."

A boom from below—something structural giving way. The tower shudders but holds. In the classroom one floor down, someone screams. But here, in their strange bubble of calm, Chloe feels safer than she has in years.

"I lied to everyone," she says. "About college. About my life. About everything."

"Why?"

"Because the truth was that I was drowning on dry land. The world was too bright, too much, too everything. I couldn't explain that I see colors that make me sick, that fluorescent lights feel like assault, that I arrange things compulsively because if I don't, the chaos of perception will drive me insane."

"But you could function during COVID."

She looks at him sharply. "How did you—"

"Your patterns started in September 2021. When campus reopened. Before that, nothing. You were fine when the world was locked down, when you could control your environment. It's the world that's the problem, not you."

"The world is still going to be there when the water goes down."

"But now you know what you have. Tetrachromacy. It's real. It's documented. It's a gift, not a disorder."

"How do you know about—"

"I researched. After I realized you could see my UV paintings. Spent nights in the library reading about color perception, about people who see more than the standard spectrum. You're not broken, Chloe. You're evolved. You're seeing wavelengths the rest of us can't access."

"It doesn't feel like evolution. It feels like drowning in rainbows."

He reaches over, not taking her hand but placing his beside it, pinky fingers barely touching. "I know about drowning in beauty. My vinyl collection—before I lost it—three thousand records. Each one a different memory, a different frequency of escape. I couldn't stop collecting, even when I knew it was destroying my life, even when it led to prison. Beauty can be addiction."

"What happened to the collection?"

"Evidence locker in Sweden. Then sold at police auction. Scattered. Twenty years of hunting, collecting, preserving—gone." His voice cracks. "Except one. I managed to save one before the arrest. Botanist—'Ecosystem.' Seven-color vinyl. I was going to give it to you."

"Was?"

"It's in my storage unit. Which is probably underwater now."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. They were just things. Beautiful things, rare things, but things. This—" He gestures to the room, the paintings, the space between them. "This is real."

Lightning illuminates everything, and in that moment, Chloe sees all his UV paintings at once—not just in this room but through the window, across the campus, a network of invisible art that maps both physical and emotional geography. Love letters to loneliness. Maps of isolation. Beauty that requires catastrophe to be seen.

"Why did you paint them? Really?"

"Because after prison, after losing everything, I needed to prove I still existed. But I couldn't be visible—my record, my status, everything made visibility dangerous. So I painted in frequencies most people can't see. I was screaming in a pitch only certain ears could hear."

"And I heard you."

"You did more than hear. You responded. You sang back."

The water is at their floor now, seeping under the door in exploratory fingers. They stand, move to the raised platform where the carillon machinery sits. Maybe six more feet of elevation. Maybe enough.

"Are you scared?" she asks.

"Terrified."

"You don't seem—"

"I'm Swedish. We don't show fear. We internalize it until it becomes furniture."

She laughs—actually laughs—while water rises and death circles. "Tell me something in Swedish."

"Jag har väntat på dig hela mitt liv."

"What does it mean?"

"I'll tell you if we survive."

"When. You keep saying when."

"Because 'if' means I've accepted drowning. And I just found you. I can't drown now."

The lights die. Three seconds. In the darkness, she reaches for his hand. Finds it. Seventeen different warms, just like she remembered from twenty months in the future—no, that's not right. This is now. This is the past that creates that future. This is the moment everything changes.

Lights return. They're holding hands. His are paint-stained, callused, shaking slightly. Hers are small, colored at the fingertips from her pencils, steady despite everything.

"What happens at 2 AM?" she asks, remembering his calculations.

"Water peaks. Either the building holds or it doesn't."

"And at 4 AM?"

"Rescue. Or sunrise. Whichever comes first."

"And then?"

"Then we get separated. Different evacuations centers. Different priorities. I'm maintenance, you're a student. They'll send us different places."

"No."

"It's protocol—"

"No." She squeezes his hand. "We don't separate. We've been having this conversation for months. We're not stopping now."

"Chloe—"

"Promise me. When they come, when they try to separate us, we stay together."

He looks at her, and she sees him make a decision. "I promise. But you have to promise me something."


"What?"

"When this is over, when we're safe, when the world goes back to normal—don't disappear. Don't go back to being invisible. We've found each other's frequency. Don't change the channel."

"I promise."

Water rises. Time compresses. They sit on the carillon platform, hands clasped, watching their reflections in the black water that's almost at their feet. In the reflection, the UV paint glows, making it seem like they're sitting in a constellation of invisible stars.

"Tell me what the Swedish meant," she says.

"When we survive."

"We might not have a when."

He turns to her. In the emergency light, she can see every detail of his face—the exhaustion, the fear, the something else that's been building between them all night.

"It means 'I've been waiting for you my whole life.'"

She kisses him.

Not because they're about to die—though they might be. Not because disaster makes people do desperate things—though it does. But because she's been waiting her whole life too, for someone who speaks her language, even when that language is colors he can't see and paint she shouldn't be able to perceive.

The kiss tastes like salt and rain and endings and beginnings. She sees colors burst behind her eyelids—not metaphorical but literal, her tetrachromacy firing in response to emotional overload. Seventeen shades of gold, forty-three varieties of silver, and something new, a color she's never seen before that she immediately names 'recognition.'

They break apart when the building shudders. Water at their feet now. Two more feet of rise and they're done.

"I should tell you—" he starts.

"No more confessions. We've told each other everything that matters."

"Not everything. My middle name is Björn."

She laughs. "Mine's Elena."

"Chloe Elena Martinez."

"Hale Björn Lindqvist."

"We sound like real people when you say it like that."

"We are real people. We're just people who see invisible things."

The water stops rising.

Just stops.

One inch from their feet, the flood peaks, holds, then slowly, impossibly, begins to recede.

"Your calculations," she breathes.

"Lucky guess."

"No. You knew. How?"

"Because I've been watching water my whole life. Växjö, where I grew up, flooded every spring. You learn to read water like language. This water was done. Tired. It had made its point."

They stay on the platform, hands still clasped, watching the water slowly retreat. Through the window, the first hint of dawn—not light yet but the promise of light, the sky going from black to the darkest purple that only Chloe can fully perceive.

"We survived," she says.

"We did."

"So tell me again, in English this time."

He turns to her, and in the almost-dawn, with water receding and UV paint glowing and the world remade by disaster, he says:

"I've been waiting for you my whole life."

"Me too," she says. "I just didn't know I was waiting until I found you."

Below them, sirens. Helicopters approaching. Rescue coming. They'll be separated soon, sent to different places, processed by different systems.

But for now, for these last minutes before the world reclaims them, they sit in their tower above the flood, two people who've been having a conversation in invisible ink, finally using words, finally seeing each other clearly in the broken light of disaster.

The water falls. The sun rises.

Their real story begins.
