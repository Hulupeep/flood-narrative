# Chapter 19: The Brother He Chose
*Tommy Chen - Multiple Timelines*

## County Jail - March 2022

Tommy Chen met Hale Lindqvist in the worst possible place under the worst possible circumstances—Santa Barbara County Jail, both awaiting trial for crimes that would define them differently than they deserved.

Tommy's crime was real but complicated: street racing that ended in property damage. No one hurt, but $50K in destroyed storefront. Stupid kid stuff that prosecutors wanted to make an example of.

Hale's crime was fictional but devastating: suspected extremism based on a vinyl record collection that included Burzum and Varg Vikernes. Some concerned citizen had seen "Permafrost" delivered to his storage unit, Googled it, found its connections to Norwegian black metal's darkest history, and called the FBI.

"You don't look like a terrorist," Tommy said on day three, when they were cellmates.

"You don't look like a street racer," Hale replied in his Swedish accent.

"Touché."

They spent two months in that cell. Tommy learned that Hale painted invisible pictures no one would ever see. Hale learned that Tommy had a photographic memory for music, could recreate any song after hearing it once. They taught each other languages—Tommy's Mandarin for Hale's Swedish, both practicing English idioms that made no sense.

"Why invisible paint?" Tommy asked one night.

"Why race cars?" Hale countered.

"To feel visible."

"Exactly backwards for me. To prove I exist without being seen."

The night before Tommy's release (charges dropped to misdemeanor, time served), he made Hale a promise: "When you get out, you've got family. Me, my crew, my connections. You won't be alone."

Hale had looked at him with those pale eyes that reflected jail fluorescents like mirrors. "I've always been alone."

"Not anymore, brother."

## November 2022 - Two Months Before the Flood

Tommy kept his promise. When Hale got out (charges dropped, but the arrest record remained, unhireable in normal jobs), Tommy got him the night maintenance position at UCSB through his cousin in facilities.

They met weekly at State Street Vinyl, where Tommy worked part-time and Hale spent his paychecks rebuilding his collection.

"You're different," Tommy noticed one evening. "Less ghost, more human."

"There's someone," Hale admitted, then immediately backtracked. "Not someone. Just... patterns. Someone's making patterns that match my paintings."

"The invisible ones?"

"Yeah."

"So someone you've never met is responding to art they can't see?"

"It sounds insane."

Tommy laughed. "Brother, I once drove a Honda Civic through a Whole Foods because I thought I could thread the needle between the automatic doors. We've got different definitions of insane."

Hale showed him photos on his phone—Chloe's color arrangements, his UV paintings, the impossible correspondence between them.

"You need to talk to her," Tommy said.

"I can't. My record—if she knew what I was accused of—"

"You were accused of bullshit. You're an artist who likes extreme music. That's not a crime."

"Tell that to Google. First result for my name is still the arrest."

Tommy understood. In the digital age, accusations were permanent, even when proven false. 

"Then show her who you really are," he said. "Paint something visible."

"I don't know how anymore."

## January 9, 2023 - The Flood

Tommy was working disaster response with the Sheriff's auxiliary when the call came in about people trapped in Storke Tower. He couldn't take that call—assigned to Goleta sector—but he tracked it obsessively.

When he saw Hale's name on the rescue list, he broke protocol, drove through three flood zones to reach the evacuation center.

He found Hale clutching a vinyl record like a life preserver, soaking wet, staring at nothing.

"Brother, you okay?"

"I found her. The pattern girl. She can see them—my paintings. She sees everything."

"Where is she?"

"Different helicopter. Different center. I don't—Tommy, I don't even know her last name."

Tommy had seen a lot of devastation that night, but nothing hit him like the devastation in Hale's voice. This was a man who'd found his frequency and lost it in the same night.

"We'll find her," Tommy promised.

"How?"

"Same way you found each other the first time. Impossible patterns that make sense only to you two."

## January 10, 2023 - The Search

Tommy drove Hale through the disaster zone to Earl Warren, using his auxiliary badge to get through checkpoints. Twelve miles of destroyed landscape for a girl Hale had known for eight hours.

"This is insane," Tommy said, navigating flooded streets.

"I know."

"You could die trying to reach her."

"I know."

"I'm proud of you, brother."

Hale looked at him, surprised. "For what?"

"For choosing to be visible. Even if it kills you."

They found her at Earl Warren, and Tommy watched from a distance as two people who'd been circling each other in invisible frequencies finally collided in the visible spectrum. He saw Chloe's parents' suspicious looks, saw Hale's fear, saw the moment when connection override everything else.

When Hale introduced him to Chloe later, Tommy kept it simple: "I'm his brother. Not by blood, but by choice. He saved my sanity in county. I owe him everything."

She'd looked at him with eyes that seemed to see too much. "He saved me too."

"Then we're family."

## Twenty Months of Searching

Tommy watched Hale paint the entire campus with UV messages. Watched him work nights and paint days, sleeping three hours if at all. Watched him turn from human to ghost and back to human, cycling through hope and despair.

"She's not coming back," Hale said one night in month six.

"She is."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're still painting for her. And somewhere, she's still arranging patterns for you."

Month twelve: "I found her Instagram. ColorSeeker93. She's been posting patterns that match my paintings."

"So contact her."

"I did. The message bounced. Account deleted."

"Then paint louder."

Month eighteen: "What if she's found someone else? Someone visible, normal, without a record?"

"Then she's not who you thought she was. But brother—what if she hasn't?"

Month twenty: "I'm tired, Tommy."

"I know."

"I don't mean sleep."

"I know that too."

Tommy held his chosen brother while he cried—first time since the flood. Then he helped him paint new UV messages, bigger, bolder, impossible to miss if you could see that spectrum.

## September 2024 - The Return

Tommy was installing a new sound system at State Street Vinyl when Maria Santos texted him: *She's back.*

He called Hale immediately. "Did you see Maria's text?"

"I can't do this."

"Yes, you can."

"What if she doesn't—"

"Hale Lindqvist, you beautiful Swedish disaster, you painted an entire campus for this woman. You turned invisible art into a homing beacon. You survived twenty months of not knowing. You can survive being seen."

"Come with me?"

"Can't, brother. This reunion needs to be yours. But I'll be here after, whatever happens."

## January 2025 - The Exhibition

Tommy stands in the museum, wearing his first suit ever, watching his chosen brother and his tetrachromatic girlfriend present their work to the world.

He thinks about county jail, about two lost kids finding brotherhood in the worst place. About promises kept and families chosen. About invisible art becoming visible love.

Chloe finds him by the bar. "Tommy, thank you."

"For what?"

"For keeping him whole while I was gone. For believing in invisible connections. For being the brother he needed."

"He saved me first. In county. I was ready to give up, become what they said I was—just another Asian kid who watched too much Fast & Furious. He showed me that we get to decide who we are, not Google, not arrest records, not anyone else."

She hugs him, and he smells paint and possibility.

"Take care of him," Tommy says.

"We take care of each other."

"Good. That's what family does."

Later, Hale finds him looking at the vinyl record in the display case—the Botanist album that survived the flood.

"That record saved my life," Hale says. "Gave me something to hold onto."

"No, brother. You saved your own life. You just needed something to remind you why."

They stand together, chosen brothers, looking at art that makes the invisible visible.

"Remember what you told me in county?" Tommy asks. "About painting for ghosts?"

"Yeah."

"You weren't painting for ghosts. You were painting for family you hadn't met yet."

Hale looks at him, then at Chloe across the room explaining tetrachromacy to fascinated visitors, then at the exhibition that proves connection can happen in any frequency.

"Tommy?"

"Yeah?"

"Thanks for driving me through the flood."

"Anytime, brother. That's what family's for—driving through disasters toward impossible love."

They clink glasses—Tommy's beer, Hale's water (he doesn't drink, never has, despite what people assume about Scandinavians).

Outside, Santa Barbara glitters with lights that look normal to most people. But Tommy's learned from Hale and Chloe that normal is just one frequency among infinite possibilities.

He thinks about his next project—converting an old van into a mobile gallery for invisible art, using UV lights and special filters to reveal hidden beauty in ordinary spaces. Hale's already agreed to paint it. Chloe will curate the colors.

Family projects. Chosen brother bringing invisible art to visible world.

Tommy Chen, former street racer, current sound engineer, forever brother to a Swedish ghost painter who turned out to be the most visible person he knows—once you learn to see in the right frequency.
