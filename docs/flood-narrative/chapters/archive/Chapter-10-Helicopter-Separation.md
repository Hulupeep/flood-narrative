# Chapter 10: The Helicopter Separation
*January 10, 2023 - 4:00 AM*

The helicopter blades sound wrong—not the rhythmic chop of rescue but something erratic, desperate, like the machine itself is struggling against the storm. Chloe and Hale stand at the top of Storke Tower's exterior emergency ladder, wind tearing at their clothes, rain that feels like ice, watching the Coast Guard helicopter fight to hover stable enough for evacuation.

"Students first," the crew chief shouts through the speaker, barely audible over the rotors and storm.

Twenty-one students below them in the stairwell, all pushing forward, ready to leave, to be anywhere but here. Chloe and Hale hang back, hands still clasped from their hours in the carillon room. Her fingers are numb except where his touch creates those seventeen warms she's memorized.

"Together," she says. "We go together."

"They won't—"

"We make them."

But the crew chief is already pointing, organizing, efficient in the way of people who've done this before. "You," he points at Chloe. "Female students, first bird. You," pointing at Hale, "essential personnel, second bird with the males."

"No, we need to—"

"No time for discussion. Move. Now."

The first helicopter is descending, basket lowering. Three female students climb in, then two more. Chloe feels Hale's hand tightening on hers.

"I'll find you," he says. "Whatever evacuation center, I'll find you."

"You don't even know my last name."

"Martinez. Chloe Elena Martinez. Registered for classes you don't attend. Lives in Montecito with parents David and Elena. Arranges pencils in patterns that match my UV paintings."

"How do you—"

"I told you. I pay attention."

The basket is in front of her now. The crew chief's hand on her arm, pulling. 

"Wait—" She turns to Hale, rain making it hard to see his face, but she catches his eyes—seventeen blues even in the helicopter's spotlight. "The record. Give me something. Anything."

He reaches into his jacket, pulls out the one thing he saved—not the Permafrost that could clear his name, but a different record, wrapped in plastic against the rain. Botanist's "Ecosystem," seven-color vinyl that had survived in his inside pocket where he'd kept it, planning to give it to her if they survived.

"When they survived," he'd said. 

They had.

"Find me," he says, pressing the record into her hands. "When this is over. When the water goes down. Find me."

"Where?"

"Where we met. Where the paint showed you the truth. Where—"

The crew chief physically lifts her into the basket. She's rising before she can resist, before she can jump out, before she can do anything but clutch the record and watch Hale get smaller below, still standing in the rain, still watching her rise.

The helicopter pulls away, fighting wind, and through the rain-lashed window she sees the second helicopter approaching. But it's smaller, different agency—California National Guard, not Coast Guard. Different destination, she realizes. Different evacuation protocol.

"Where are we going?" she shouts to the crew member.

"Red Cross shelter, Earl Warren Showgrounds. You'll be processed there."

"The other helicopter—where's it going?"

"Different route. They're taking essential personnel to UCSB emergency command at Harder Stadium. Workers only."

Her heart breaks. Different locations. Different processing. No way to find each other in the chaos that follows disasters—thousands of evacuees, no working phones, no way to communicate.

She watches through the window as the second helicopter hovers over the tower. Watches tiny figures climb into the basket. Tries to see which one is Hale but they're all just shapes in the darkness, in the rain, in the space between salvation and separation.

The record in her hands is warm—maybe from his pocket, maybe from her grip. Through the plastic, she can see the vinyl's colors shifting in the emergency lights of the helicopter. Seven colors to normal eyes. Seventy to hers. Seven hundred if she really looks, if she catalogues every shade and gradient and frequency.

"You okay?" the crew member asks.

She's not. She's leaving half of herself on that tower. The half that learned to be honest. The half that kissed someone while thinking they'd die. The half that finally found someone who could see her invisible frequencies.

"The people in the other helicopter," she says. "Is there a list? A way to track—"

"Everything's chaos right now, miss. Once you're processed, you can file a missing persons report if you're looking for someone."

Missing person. Is that what he is now? Or was he always missing, and she'd just found him for a few hours in a tower while water rose?

The helicopter banks hard, swinging over the drowned campus. In the spotlight beam, she can see the water everywhere—not flood but ocean, like California has been reclaimed by the Pacific. And throughout it, invisible to the crew but blazing in her tetrachromatic vision, UV paint glowing under the emergency lights. His paintings, his maps, his love letters to no one that turned out to be love letters to her.

They're over Montecito now. Her parents' neighborhood is dark, evacuated. She wonders where they are, if they're safe, if they know she's alive. She'll find them at the evacuation center. She'll lie to them about where she's been, what happened. She'll tell them she was in the library, studying, when the flood came. She won't tell them about the tower, about Hale, about learning to tell the truth while expecting to die.

The record is cutting into her palms from how hard she's gripping it. She loosens her hold, sees the track listing through the plastic. Song titles she doesn't recognize, but one catches her eye: "Invisible Frequencies." 

Of course.

The helicopter descends toward the showgrounds. She can see the Red Cross tents, the buses of evacuees arriving, the chaos of disaster management. Thousands of people. How will he find her in this? How will she find him?

But then she remembers: he's painted the whole campus with UV messages. He's been leaving breadcrumbs she can follow. And now she has his name—Hale Björn Lindqvist—and the knowledge that he'll be at Harder Stadium with essential personnel.

The helicopter touches down. Volunteers rush forward with blankets, clipboards, organized chaos. She's processed—name, address, injuries (none visible), immediate needs (none she can articulate). They assign her a cot number, point her toward the tent where she can rest, get food, wait for news.

But she doesn't go to the tent. She stands in the rain, clutching the record, looking back toward campus. Toward the tower where they were trapped. Toward wherever his helicopter has taken him.

"I'll find you," she whispers to the rain, to the dark, to the space between them that's growing with every second. "When the water goes down. When the world stops ending. I'll find you."

She doesn't know it will take twenty months.

She doesn't know he'll be looking for her in all the wrong places while she searches for him everywhere but where he is.

She doesn't know that finding someone after a flood is harder than finding them during one.

All she knows is the weight of the record in her hands, the memory of seventeen different warms, the taste of a kiss that was supposed to be goodbye but became hello.

The rain keeps falling. The water keeps rising. And somewhere across the drowned city, Hale is in a different evacuation center, probably thinking the same thing she is:

*This can't be how our conversation ends.*

But for now, it is.

The separation has begun.
