# Wrong Names
*January 10, 2023, 7:30 AM - After Separation*

---

Different tents. Different colors. Different worlds.

Chloe stands in Red Cross Station B, still wrapped in someone else's blanket that smells like someone else's disaster. Through the tent flap, she can see Station A—where they took him. Maybe. If he made it down. If another helicopter came.

"Name?"

Third time they've asked. Third time she's answered. Third time they write it wrong.

"Chloe Martinez. I was in the Carillon Tower with—"

"We have you logged. Carillon Tower, rescued 6:47 AM. Solo evacuation."

"Not solo. There was someone else—"

But the volunteer's already moved on. Clipboard thick with names that might be wrong, addresses that don't exist anymore, phone numbers for towers that won't work for days.

---

## The Lists

[Kinetic structure - short, desperate bursts]

She finds the board where they're posting names.

*Station A Arrivals - Updated 8 AM*

Scans. No Hale. No Lars. No Lindqvist. No Holstrom.

But there—handwritten addition at bottom:
*Swedish male, 20s, no ID*

Her heart does something impossible—stops and races simultaneously. Swedish male. That's him. Has to be.

"Excuse me, the Swedish male—where is he?"

"Transferred to County Medical. Hypothermia."

"When?"

"Twenty minutes ago."

Twenty minutes. Always twenty minutes too late.

---

## The Phone

[ONE privileged perception - disaster colors]

The charging station looks like aftermath given form. Dozens of phones in various states of drowning, each pulsing with what Chloe's tetrachromacy reads as grief-frequency—purple-black with edges of desperate yellow.

Her phone: dead.

His number: memorized in the tower. 

But was it real? In crisis, in thinking they'd die, did she imagine him saying the numbers? The Swedish accent making sevens sound like something else?

She borrows someone's phone. Dials.

"The number you have reached is not in service."

Of course it isn't. Tower's down. Or she remembered wrong. Or he gave her the wrong number. Or—

"You okay, honey?"

A woman, maybe sixty, flood mud still in her hair. Eyes kind in the way that only comes from seeing too much.

"I lost someone."

"We all lost someone."

"No, I mean—" How to explain? "I just found him. Last night. In the tower. And now—"

"Now he's gone."

Not a question. The woman knows this specific loss—not death but disappearance, not grief but uncertainty.

## Maria's Arrival

[Free indirect - relief without announcement]

Maria crashes into the tent like salvation wearing yesterday's makeup.

"Chloe! Ay, Dios mío, I've been looking everywhere—mija, we thought—"

The hug smells like home. Like normal. Like before-flood when things made sense.

"They said you were in the tower. They said—" Maria pulls back, studies her. "You look different."

Different. Because she kissed someone thinking they'd die. Because she learned about seventeen warms. Because she lost him before having him.

"There was someone else. In the tower."

"Who?"

"The maintenance ghost. The UV painter. His name is Hale."

Maria's face does something complicated—recognition fighting with confusion.

"The Swedish guy? Tall, quiet, works nights?"

"You know him?"

"I mean, I've seen him around. But Chloe—" She stops. "They're saying he was arrested months ago. Some extremist thing."

"That was a lie. Mistake. He told me—"

"When?"

"In the tower. When we thought—" 

The words stop. Can't say: When we thought we'd die. When we kissed. When everything became true.

## The Search Begins

[Tick-tock - subtle time pressure]

County Medical: thirty minutes by car on normal days.
Today: roads flooded, bridges compromised, nothing normal.

"I'll drive you," Maria says.

But her car is underwater. Everyone's cars are underwater. The buses aren't running. The whole city is broken into islands of dry land surrounded by what the storm left behind.

"There's a Red Cross shuttle in an hour," someone says.

An hour. But Swedish male, no ID, transferred twenty minutes ago. By the time she gets there—

"He might not even be there," Maria says gently. "It might not be him."

But Chloe knows. The seventeen warms still pulse in her palms. His frequency still hums in her bones. He's there. Somewhere. Swedish male, no ID, hypothermic but alive.

Has to be.

## The Wrong Names

[ONE double-encoded scene - truth beneath lies]

"I need to file a missing person report."

The officer looks exhausted. Probably been up all night pulling people from cars, from trees, from water.

"Name of missing person?"

"Hale Lindqvist. H-A-L-E."

He writes. She watches. He gets it right.

"Relationship?"

[Surface: What's your connection?]
[Underneath: What was he to you?]

"We were—" What? Not friends. Not dating. Not anything with a name. "We were in the tower together."

"During the flood?"

"Yes."

"And you were separated during rescue?"

"Different helicopters."

He writes: *Evacuation partners separated.*

Wrong but also right. Partners in evacuation. Partners in thinking they'd die. Partners in seventeen warms and impossible colors.

"We'll add him to the list. Check back in 48 hours."

Forty-eight hours. Two days. Two days of not knowing if he made it down, if he's hurt, if he's looking for her too.

---

## The UV Discovery

Back at Station B, the sun hits the tent wall at that angle—thirty-seven degrees. And there, in UV paint only she can see:

*C - Building 7 - H*

Fresh. Still wet in frequencies others can't perceive.

He was here.

Is here?

Building 7. She runs.

---

## The Miss

[Status flip - hope to devastation]

Building 7 is empty. Evacuated. But on the wall, in UV:

*Missed you by minutes. Looking. -H*

Minutes. Always minutes.

She writes back, uses a Sharpie that won't show UV but might show something:

*Station B. Looking too. -C*

And then, because true things need saying:

*Seventeen warms.*

Anyone else reading it: means nothing.
Him reading it: means everything.

---

## The Pattern Emerges

[Free indirect - realization dawning]

Back at Station B, Maria waiting with news:

"They're consolidating stations. Moving everyone to the campus gym."

The gym. Where thousands will gather. Where finding one Swedish male, no ID, becomes impossible.

But also—

Where everyone goes. Where he'll go if he's looking.

"When?"

"Now. Buses loading."

Chloe looks back at Building 7. At her message. Will he see it? Will he know?

The bus horn sounds. Last call.

She gets on.

As they pull away, she sees through the window—someone tall running toward Building 7. Swedish-shaped. But the bus turns, and the angle breaks, and she can't see if he finds her message.

Can't see if he reads: *Seventeen warms.*

Can't see if he understands: *I remember. I'm looking. This was real.*

---

## Arriving at Chaos

The gym: controlled disaster. Thousands of cots. Hundreds of volunteers. Names being called over speakers that echo wrong. Families finding each other. Others, like her, searching faces for someone who might not be there.

She walks the rows. Studies every tall shape. Counts seventeen different types of not-him.

Maria stays close. "We'll find him."

But Chloe knows—in a space this big, with this many people, with wrong names and no systems—finding becomes miracle.

Still, she looks.

Still, she hopes.

Still, her hands hold seventeen warms that prove he existed.

That prove he exists.

Somewhere.

## EMOTIONAL BEATS ACHIEVED

✅ **Morning chaos and confusion**
- Multiple stations, wrong names, missed connections
- Twenty minutes too late (recurring theme)
- Systems breaking down

✅ **The searching begins**
- UV messages as breadcrumbs
- Just missing each other
- Hope battling devastation

✅ **Human moments**
- Maria as anchor to normal
- Woman who understands specific loss
- "Evacuation partners separated"

✅ **Surgical techniques**
- ONE perception (disaster colors)
- ONE double-encoded (relationship question)
- Kinetic structure for chaos
- ONE status flip (hope to loss)

**Result**: Chapter 8 bridges the tower intimacy to the separation trauma, showing how disaster systems fail human connection, setting up twenty months of searching through bureaucratic wrongness and missed chances by minutes.
