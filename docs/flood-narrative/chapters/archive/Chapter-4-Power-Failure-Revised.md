# Chapter 4: Power Failure (Revised)
*January 9, 2023 - 8:00 PM*

The lights die without warning.

One moment Chloe is arranging sugar packets in the third-floor study room, creating patterns to calm the anxiety crawling through her chest, and the next she's in absolute darkness. Outside, the rain hammers like it's trying to break through the windows. The building groans.

Then the emergency lights kick in—harsh, UV-tinged, battery-powered—and the world explodes.

"What the—" she gasps, stumbling backward.

The walls are covered in paint. Invisible paint suddenly visible. Messages, patterns, art that wasn't there seconds ago—or was it? Her eyes struggle to process what she's seeing. Blues that shouldn't exist. Purples that have no names. The paintings seem to pulse and breathe in the emergency lighting, revealing layers and depths that make her dizzy.

She's been here dozens of times. Studied in this exact room. Never saw any of this.

But now, in this specific light, it's everywhere. Beautiful and terrifying and impossible.

"You can see them?"

She spins. A tall figure in the doorway—maintenance uniform, black hair, face half-shadowed. She's noticed him before, the quiet one who works nights, who never makes eye contact, who moves through campus like a ghost.

"The paintings," he says, stepping forward, and his voice has an accent—Swedish? "You can actually see them?"

"I—" She looks at the walls again. The messages are in English, Swedish, symbols she doesn't recognize. But the colors—god, the colors are speaking directly to her brain in a language she didn't know she understood. "What is this? What did you—"

"UV paint. It's only visible under blacklight or—" He gestures at the emergency lighting. "These specific frequencies. But you're seeing more than just the paint, aren't you? You're seeing the layers."

She nods, unable to look away from the walls. "There's... there must be fifty different shades of blue in that one section alone. And the way they overlap creates new colors that—that shouldn't exist."

He moves closer, slowly, like approaching a spooked animal. "How many colors do you see? In general, I mean. Not just my paintings."

"I don't know. More than other people. Always have. I thought everyone saw like this until I was seven and my art teacher told me I was using colors that weren't in the box, that I was making them up." She touches the wall, traces a pattern that shifts from violet to something beyond violet. "I'm not making them up."

"No," he says quietly. "You're not."

The building shudders. Somewhere below, glass breaks.

"We need to move," he says. "The lagoon is overflowing. First floor is already flooding."

But she can't stop staring at the paintings. Now that she sees them, she realizes they're responses—visual responses to her arrangements. That spiral of blue-green-silver matches exactly the pencil pattern she made last week. That burst of gold-coral-pearl mirrors her sugar packet arrangement from an hour ago.

"You've been watching me," she says, but it's not an accusation.

"You've been arranging things in patterns that match my paintings. Patterns I painted before you started doing it. Like we've been having a conversation neither of us could hear."

The lights flicker. When they steady, she sees his face clearly for the first time. Pale eyes that reflect the emergency lighting in ways that make them look silver. Sharp features softened by something vulnerable, uncertain.

"I'm Hale," he says.

"Chloe."

Another shudder. The sound of water rushing somewhere below.

"Chloe, we need to go. Now. The tower—Storke Tower has a carillon room at the top. It's the highest point on campus. If we can get there—"

"Wait." She grabs his arm. "How long have you been painting these? How long have we been—"

"Four months. Since September. You sat on that bench by the lagoon and arranged pencils in a pattern I'd painted the night before. Perfect match. Impossible coincidence." He covers her hand with his—warm, steadier than she expected. "I've been painting for you ever since. And you've been responding, haven't you? Even without knowing it."

The water sound is getting louder. Through the window, she can see the lagoon has become an ocean, swallowing the paths she walked this afternoon.

"We can talk about this in the tower," he says. "If we don't drown first."

She looks at the walls one more time—their invisible conversation made visible by disaster—then nods. "Lead the way."

He does, and as they run through hallways lit by emergency lighting, she sees his paintings everywhere. The entire building is a gallery hidden in plain sight. Messages in frequencies only she can see, that were waiting for exactly this moment—power failure, emergency lights, two people who've been unconsciously calling to each other finally hearing the response.

"How is this possible?" she asks as they hit the stairwell, starting to climb.

"I don't know. But Chloe—" He turns back, his face serious in the stuttering emergency lights. "I've been painting for ghosts my whole life. You're the first person who's ever seen them. Really seen them."

"I see everything," she admits, the truth spilling out as they climb higher, water rising below. "Too much. Colors that don't have names. Patterns that make people think I'm crazy."

"You're not crazy. You're tetrachromatic."

She stops. "You know about—"

"I researched it. After I realized you could see my UV work. Some women have four color cones instead of three. You can see millions of colors others can't. Including UV spectrums that—"

A crash below. Water hitting the second floor.

"Climb," he says. "I'll explain everything. But first, we survive this."

They run up the stairs, and she follows the ghost painter who's been leaving her invisible messages, whose art she's been unconsciously responding to, who sees her gift as a gift instead of a disorder.

The water rises. The emergency lights flicker. And in the stairwell of a drowning building, two people who've been having a conversation in frequencies nobody else can perceive finally realize they've been looking for each other all along.

"There," he says as they reach the seventh floor, pointing to a door. "The carillon room. We can wait it out there."

She reaches for the handle, then pauses. "Hale? After this—after the water goes down—will I still be able to see them? Your paintings?"

"Only if you know where to look. Or..." He pulls something from his pocket—a small UV flashlight. "Or if you have this."

She takes it, clicks it on, and gasps. Even the stairwell is covered in his work. Words in a dozen languages, patterns that mirror every arrangement she's made since September, and over and over, in Swedish and English and visual languages that transcend words: *Where are you? I'm here. Can you see this? Please see this.*

"I see it," she whispers. "I see all of it."

The water roars below, but for a moment, in the UV light in a flooding stairwell, Chloe feels found. Not rescued—found. Like she's been sending signals into the dark for twenty years and finally, impossibly, someone is signaling back.

"Come on," Hale says, opening the door to the carillon room. "Let's not drown now that we've found each other."

She follows him in, knowing that after tonight, nothing will be invisible between them again.
