# Chapter 9: The Reunion
*September 2024 - Tuesday, 2:00 PM*

Chloe climbs the stairs slowly, each step a decision to continue. The broken elevator feels like a test—if you want this reunion, you have to work for it, fight gravity and doubt with every floor.

She's wearing the seafoam sweater from March 13, 2020—the last normal day before COVID, before everything broke. It has fifteen shades of seafoam that only she can see, the exact color of hope before it drowns. She's not sure why she chose it. Armor, maybe. Or invitation. Or proof that some things survive even when everything else is lost.

The seventh floor. The eighth. 

Her phone says 1:58 PM.

At the ninth floor landing, she stops. Through the small window in the stairwell door, she can see into the carillon room. 

He's there.

Standing with his back to the door, facing the windows that show the rebuilt campus, the refilled lagoon, the world that drowned and returned. He's wearing maintenance clothes but newer ones, crisp edges that haven't learned to be invisible yet. His hair is different—the dye growing out, showing dark honey underneath the artificial black, like truth emerging through disguise.

1:59 PM.

She could leave. Run down nine flights and drive away and never know if what happened that night was real connection or just two people clinging to each other while death circled. She could preserve the perfect memory of that kiss, that promise, that moment when water stopped rising exactly at their feet like the universe itself was invested in their survival.

2:00 PM.

She opens the door.

He doesn't turn. But his shoulders change—tension leaving or arriving, she can't tell which.

"You came," he says to the window.

"You knew I would."

"I hoped. Hope and knowing are different things."

She recognizes the words—the same thing Maria said. They've been talking about her, planning this, orchestrating this moment while she searched everywhere but here.

"Turn around," she says.

"Not yet."

"Why?"

"Because once I see you, really see you in daylight without water rising, everything changes. We become real. And real things can disappoint."

She steps into the room, lets the door close behind her. The bells above them are silent, but she remembers their cacophony, bronze and terror and underneath it all, his voice promising they'd survive.

"We're already real," she says. "We've been real since you painted your first UV message and I arranged colors in response."

"That was art. This is life."

"What's the difference?"

Now he turns.

Twenty months have changed him. Exhaustion has been replaced by something else—purpose, maybe. Or patience. The haunted look is still there but softer, like grief that's learned to coexist with hope. His eyes are still seventeen different blues, but she sees new colors now—gold at the edges, green when the light hits right, the aurora borealis she'd named him that night still burning underneath but controlled, contained.

"Hi," he says.

"Hi."

They stand there, ten feet apart, twenty months and one night collapsed into this moment.

"You look—" he starts.

"Different?"

"The same. Exactly the same but also completely different. Like a painting that's been restored. Same image but the colors are clearer."

"You can't see colors like I do."

"No, but I've been learning. Dr. Tanaka has been teaching me about tetrachromacy. About what you see. I've been mixing paints trying to match your spectrum."

"Why?"

"Because I wanted to paint something you could see completely. Not just UV messages but the full range of what your eyes can process." He gestures to the ceiling. "Look up."

She does.

The ceiling is covered in new paint—not UV but regular paint in impossible combinations. Hundreds of shades that shouldn't exist, mixed and layered to create depth that normal eyes would see as mud but her tetrachromatic vision processes as symphony. It's their story—the flood, the separation, the search—painted in colors only she can fully perceive.

"How long did this take?"

"Twenty months. I added to it every day. Maria let me in even when the building was closed. It's my apology."

"For what?"

"For disappearing. For not finding you. For being too scared to believe you'd want me in daylight."

She steps closer. Eight feet between them now. "I searched everywhere."

"I know. I followed your search. Santa Barbara, Solvang, Los Angeles. You went to my uncle's bakery four times."

"He said he didn't know where you were."

"He lied. I was in the back, hiding. Covered in flour so you wouldn't recognize me. Watching you through the kitchen window."

"Why?"

"Because you were so bright. So alive. So much more than I remembered. And I was still just a maintenance worker with a suspicious past and paint under his fingernails. The flood made us equal—both drowning. But in regular life..."

"Stop." She's five feet away now. Close enough to see the paint stains on his hands—seventeen different colors, just like that night. "In regular life, I'm a college dropout who lies to everyone and sees colors that make me sick. You're an artist who speaks in frequencies only I can hear. We're exactly equal. Equally broken. Equally searching. Equally found."

"Chloe—"

"No. My turn to talk. Twenty months, Hale. Twenty months I thought you were gone. Dead, maybe. Or disappeared back to Sweden. Twenty months of seeing UV paint in my dreams, of arranging pencils hoping you'd somehow see them, of that kiss haunting every attempt at normal life."

"I'm sorry—"

"I'm not done. You saved the Botanist record. You painted breadcrumbs all over campus. You built me a future in UV paint—Maria told me. Museums, universities, a life where my tetrachromacy is gift not curse. You've been loving me for twenty months without knowing if I'd come back."

"Yes."

"And I've been loving you. Without knowing if you were even alive. So don't tell me the flood made us equal. We were equal before. Two people seeing invisible things, making art for no one, waiting without knowing we were waiting."

Three feet between them now.

"I'm different," he says. "Twenty months of recovery, of therapy, of learning to be visible. I work days now. People see me. I have a new collection but it's small, careful. I'm rebuilding but slowly. I might never be who I was before prison, before the flood, before—"

"Good. I don't want who you were before. I want who you are now. Who you're becoming." She reaches out, not quite touching, her hand hovering near his. "The question is: do you want who I am now? Not the girl from the flood but the woman who came back?"

He looks at her hand, then at her face, then at her hand again. When he reaches out, their fingers don't quite meet—an inch of charged space between them, like that moment before lightning strikes.

"There's something I need to tell you," he says.

"Another confession?"

"No. A proposal."

Her heart stops. Restarts. Races.

"Not that kind," he says quickly. "An art proposal. Dr. Tanaka has funding for a project. Documenting how tetrachromats see the world. She wants you as primary observer and me as artistic translator. We'd work together, creating a visual language for colors that don't have names. Painting what you see so others can understand. Making the invisible visible."

"Together."

"Every day. For at least a year. Maybe more."

"And after that?"

"After that, we figure out what comes next. Together or apart, depending on what we discover."

"What if we discover it was just trauma bonding? That without death circling, we have nothing?"

He finally bridges that last inch, his fingers touching hers. Seventeen different warms, just like she remembered. But also something new—steadiness where there used to be shaking, certainty where there used to be desperation.

"Then at least we'll have made something beautiful while discovering that. But Chloe—"

"What?"

"I've been painting you for twenty months. Not your face but your frequencies. The way you arranged those pencils. The colors you see that I can't. The space you left in every room after you were gone. If that's not love, then I need a new word for what it is."

She threads her fingers through his, and it's nothing like that night—no desperation, no fear, no water rising. Just two hands finding each other in daylight, in safety, in the ordinary miracle of Tuesday afternoon.

"I know a word," she says.

"Swedish?"

"No. One of mine. From that night." She pulls him closer, until she can see all seventeen blues of his eyes, all forty-three shades of hope in his expression. "Recognition. That's what this is. What it's always been. I recognize you."

"And I recognize you."

They don't kiss. Not yet. This moment is too fragile, too important to rush. Instead, they stand there, hands clasped, foreheads almost touching, breathing the same air that doesn't taste like flood or endings but like possibility.

"So," she says finally. "The project. When do we start?"

"Now, if you want. I have paint in the supply closet. You have your eyes. We could begin documenting this moment—the colors you see when recognition happens."

"What makes you think recognition has colors?"

He smiles—the same smile from that night but fuller now, unafraid. "Everything has colors for you. Even things that shouldn't. Even invisible things. Especially invisible things."

She laughs, and in laughing, realizes this is real. They're real. The flood brought them together, but choice is keeping them here, in this tower that survived the water, in this room where they first spoke truth, in this moment when twenty months collapses into now.

"Show me the paint," she says.

He leads her to the supply closet, and she sees he's been preparing—hundreds of tubes, jars, powders, mediums. Raw materials for making visible what only she can see.

"Where do we start?" he asks.

She looks at him, at the room, at the light coming through the windows at exactly the right angle to reveal every layer of UV paint from that night, ghostly but present, memory made visible.

"We start with the color of water stopping exactly at our feet. The color of impossible luck. The color of the universe taking our side."

"What color is that?"

She squeezes his hand, feels those seventeen warms that announced him before she knew his name, and says:

"It's the color of finding what you didn't know you'd lost. The color of losing everything and discovering what remains. The color of things we lost in the flood that turned out not to be things at all."

They begin.
