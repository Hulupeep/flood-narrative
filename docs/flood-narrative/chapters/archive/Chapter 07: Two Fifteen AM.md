# Two Fifteen AM
*January 10, 2023, 2:15 AM - Storke Tower*

---

Water touches the door.

Not enters. Touches. Like a predator testing the boundaries of its prey.

Chloe stands on the desk—highest point in a shrinking world. Hale beside her, his heat signature seventeen different temperatures that her synesthesia converts to sound: a low hum like cello strings tightening before they snap.

"How long?" Her voice doesn't shake. Past fear now. Into whatever comes after.

He checks the door. Water seeps underneath—dark fingers reaching. "Twenty minutes. Maybe less."


The emergency lights flicker. Battery dying. Soon darkness will swallow the UV paintings, erase their invisible gallery, make everything equally nothing.

"I need to tell you—" they say simultaneously.

Stop. Look at each other. In failing light, his face shifts through spectrums—visible to UV to something beyond classification. Her tetrachromatic eyes catch frequencies that exist only in this moment: fear-silver, resignation-gold, something else that might be love if love had a color at the end of the world.

"You first," she says.

"No. Together. Same time."

"That's impossible—"

"Everything we are is impossible. UV painter. Tetrachromat. Unconscious conversation through invisible art. Why stop at impossible now?"

## The Confession: Double-Encoded


They count to three. Seventeen times three. Their mathematics of disaster.

"I've been looking for you my whole life," they say.

Not simultaneously. Overlapping. His words in Swedish-accented English, hers in California angles, but same sentence. Same impossibility.

They laugh—sound that looks like golden static in her peripheral vision.

"How?" she asks.

"How what?"

"How did we say—?"

"Because true things don't need different words."

Water rises. Ankle deep on the desk now. Cold that transcends temperature—her synesthesia reads it as the color of endings: black-silver-pearl with edges that taste like copper snow.

"What else?" he asks. "What else needs saying?"

"Everything."

"Then tell me everything. Fast."

## Everything, Fast: Kinetic Acceleration

"I see you in colors that don't exist."

"I painted you before knowing you existed."

"Your voice tastes like electricity and mint."

"Your eyes see through dimensions."

"I arrange things to match your paintings without meaning to."

"I paint responses to arrangements I've never seen."

"You make seventeen mean something beyond number."

"You make invisible mean not alone."

Water at their knees. Rising faster. Desk floating.

"I'm terrified—"

"Me too—"

"Not of dying—"

"No—"

"Of not saying—"

"I know—"

"That this is—"

"Love."

The word hangs between them like UV paint—visible only in specific conditions, from certain angles, to eyes that see beyond the spectrum.

## The Kiss: Privileged Perception Explodes

He reaches for her through water that wants them dead.

She reaches back through darkness that's almost complete.

They meet in space that shouldn't exist—between drowning and flying, between visible and invisible, between terrified and certain.

His mouth finds hers.

The world explodes into frequencies.

She doesn't just feel the kiss—she sees it, hears it, tastes it in dimensions that shouldn't exist:

- **Visual**: Behind closed eyes, geometries of light that pulse gold-silver-UV-infinite, fractals spreading like backwards lightning, colors being born that have never existed before
- **Auditory**: The kiss creates sound—not metaphorical but literal vibration her brain interprets as symphony in keys that haven't been invented
- **Gustatory**: Tastes like mint and copper and snow and electricity and something ancient, like the first word ever spoken
- **Olfactory**: Smells like Swedish pine and California sage and salt water and UV paint and home, always home
- **Tactile**: Seventeen different pressures, seventeen different temperatures, but also something beyond—like touching the frequency of existence itself
- **Temporal**: Time splits—the kiss lasts three seconds and three hours and three lifetimes simultaneously

The emergency light dies completely. Darkness absolute. But she still sees him—not with eyes but with whatever sense recognizes souls in blackness.

"I see you," she says against his mouth. "Even in darkness. Especially in darkness."

## After: The Water Stops

They break apart when they realize—

"Listen," he says.

Silence. Not just quiet. Absence. The water has stopped rising.

"Is it—?"

"Stopped. At our chests but stopped."


"We're not dying," she says, and it sounds like disappointment.

"You wanted to die?"

"No. I wanted—" How to explain? "The kiss made sense when dying. Like period at end of sentence. Now it's—"

"Comma?"

"Beginning."

## In Darkness: Free Indirect Merge

Can't see him but feels him everywhere—seventeen warms radiating through water, through darkness, through impossibility.

They float together. No other choice. Desk submerged. Bodies keeping bodies alive.

His arms around her waist. Her back against his chest. Both kicking slowly to stay afloat. Synchronized without trying. Like their bodies know rhythms their minds haven't learned.

"Tell me what you see," he says. Strange request in absolute darkness.

But she looks anyway. Lets her tetrachromacy stretch into spectrums beyond light:

"Phosphenes. You know—pressure patterns behind eyelids. But more. Like... darkness has colors too. Ninety-three shades of black, each one different frequency."

"What else?"

"You. Not seeing—sensing. Your body heat creates outline in darkness. Like infrared but shifted into spectrum I can process. You're shaped like light that gave up being bright."

"Poetry?"

"Description. I see you in ways that don't have words."

"Make words. We're good at that."

She thinks. "Mörkerglow."

"Swedish-English?"

"Darkness-glow. What you look like when light stops working."

His laugh vibrates through water, through her body, creates waves her skin reads as color—gold-warm-safe.

"What happens when rescue comes?" he asks.

## Future Tense in Dark Water


"We stay together."

"In helicopter?"

"In everything."

"They might separate us—"

"Then we find each other."

"How?"

"Same way we did before. Through art. Through impossible frequencies."

"That took twenty months—"

"No. We were already finding each other. Just didn't know it."

Water laps at their necks. Death still possible, just postponed.

"I want to make something with you," she says.

"Art?"

"Everything. Art. Language for impossible colors. Life in spectrums others can't see."

"That's what you want? If we survive?"

"When. When we survive."

His arms tighten—seventeen pressures intensifying into seventy into seven hundred points of contact that say what words can't.

"Then we make everything," he says.

## Dawn: The Revelation

Light creeps through windows. Not much. Dawn struggling through storm clouds. But enough.

The room reveals itself in stages:
- Water, chest-high, black with debris
- UV paintings, somehow still visible in dawn's specific frequency
- Them, still afloat, still together, still impossible

"Look," she says.

He turns to where she's pointing. On the ceiling—the only surface he couldn't reach—she sees it clearly with her tetrachromatic eyes:

Someone else's UV painting. Older. Different hand.

Words in spectrum only she can process: "Love persists in frequencies beyond visible."

"You didn't paint that."

"No."

"Then who—?"

"Someone else who saw invisible. Someone else who loved in spectrums."


Voices outside. Real rescue this time.

"Ready?" he asks.

She turns in his arms. Sees him properly in dawn light—exhausted, soaked, paint still under fingernails, beautiful in seventeen different ways plus infinite more she's still discovering.

"For rescue?"

"For everything after."

She kisses him again. Softer this time. Not ending but beginning. Tastes like sunrise through flood water—impossible but happening anyway.

"Ready," she says.

The ladder appears at the window.

Time to leave their tower.

Time to begin.
