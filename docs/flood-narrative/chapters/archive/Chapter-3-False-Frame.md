# Chapter 3: The Library (Maintaining False Frame)
*September 2024*

The automatic doors of Davidson Library whoosh open, and Chloe immediately knows she shouldn't have come.

The walls are doing that thing again—shimmering when she's not looking directly, like reality is thin here, ready to tear. Her therapist would call this "environmental triggering." The place where normal cracked open twenty months ago, where she first started seeing things that weren't there.

*Or things that were there but shouldn't be.*

She forces herself forward. A student worker approaches, bright-eyed, definitely wasn't here for the flood.

"Can I help you?"

"Has maintenance been through here today?" The question comes out wrong, too urgent.

"Um, maybe? There was a tall guy fixing something near the stairs like twenty minutes ago. Why?"

*Twenty minutes.* Her hands start their nervous ritual, reaching for the pens on the info desk, arranging them by shade. The girl watches, confused, as Chloe creates a gradient from black through gray to silver—a pattern that feels like answering a question nobody asked.

"Sorry," Chloe mutters, pulling back. "I have... a thing. With patterns."

"OCD?"

"Something like that."

But it's not OCD. It's something else, something the doctors can't name. The compulsion to arrange colors in sequences that match the shimmer-patterns only she can see. Like she's having a conversation with her hallucinations.

*That way madness lies.*

The stairs feel different under her feet—same metal, but wrong somehow. There's something on the underside of the railing. Marks? Dirt? When she touches them, they feel warm, alive, like they were just made. Arrow shapes pointing up.

*Following hallucinated arrows. Totally normal behavior.*

Third floor. Her spot. Their spot—if he was ever real.

The corner has been rebuilt, new furniture that doesn't remember the flood. She sits, places her hands flat on the desk, and that's when she feels it: grooves in the surface. Deliberate marks. Numbers? She traces them with her fingers—coordinates, maybe. 

Real or imagined? The texture feels too specific to be her mind inventing it.

She enters the coordinates into her phone. They point to a location in the library. This floor. The stacks.

*This is insane. You're following a treasure map that might not exist to find a person who might be a trauma-induced fantasy.*

But she goes anyway.

The stacks are darker, quieter. Someone's following her—she can hear footsteps that stop when she stops, start when she starts. She spins around. Nobody there. But a book has been pulled forward on the shelf: *The Linguistics of Visual Art.*

Inside, there's something that makes her heart stop—a piece of vinyl record, cut into a bookmark. She knows this album. Botanist's "Ecosystem." The exact record Hale gave her in the tower, his most precious possession, proof he was real.

Unless her mind is creating evidence for its own delusions.

The vinyl has marks on it—writing maybe, in that same shimmer-substance that might be paint or might be her neurons misfiring. She can almost read it:

*Tuesday. 2 PM. Where the water stopped rising.*

"Chloe?"

She jumps. Marcus—her friend from before, from Discord, from the real world where she was just weird, not crazy.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," he says.

"Maybe I have."

He looks at the vinyl in her hand, and his expression changes. "Where did you get that?"

"You can see it?" The relief nearly drops her to her knees.

"Of course I can see it. It's a piece of vinyl. But Chloe—" He holds it to the light. "This is from an original pressing. Worth hundreds. Someone destroyed a valuable record to make this."

So it's real. The vinyl is real. But that doesn't mean the messages she sees on it are real.

"Have you seen anyone leaving these around?" she asks.

"No, but..." Marcus hesitates. "There's been someone on campus. Maintenance guy. He does something to the walls—I've seen him touching them, like he's checking for cracks or something. But there are never any cracks."

"You've seen him?"

"Tall, Swedish-looking? Yeah. He's hard to miss. Moves like he's trying not to exist." Marcus studies her face. "Chloe, what's going on? You look scared."

She almost tells him everything—the flood, the tower, the eight hours with someone who might have been real, the things she sees that shouldn't exist. But how do you explain that you might be in love with a hallucination? That you see messages in frequencies nobody else can perceive?

"I think I'm sick," she says instead. "Seeing things."

"What kind of things?"

"Messages. Patterns. Light where there shouldn't be light." She laughs, but it sounds broken. "Classic psychosis symptoms, right?"

Marcus doesn't laugh. "Or you're seeing something real that others can't. Not everything invisible is imaginary."

Before she can respond, movement catches her eye—a maintenance cart passing outside. The driver is just a silhouette, but something about the way he moves...

She runs to the window, presses against it. The cart's already disappearing around the corner, but on the seat, she glimpses something—another piece of vinyl.

"I have to go," she tells Marcus.

"Chloe, wait—"

But she's already running, chasing ghosts or truth, not sure which. The cart is gone by the time she gets outside, but the vinyl is there, warm like someone was just holding it.

More of that shimmer-writing:

*Stop running. Start seeing. I'm exactly where I've always been.*

She turns slowly, examining everything with her broken/blessed eyes. The campus looks normal except for the places where it doesn't—walls that shimmer, paths that glow faintly, patterns everywhere that might be art or might be her mind creating meaning from chaos.

Then she sees him. Or thinks she does. A figure by the lagoon, tall, dark-haired, sitting on the bench where she used to arrange her pencils. Her bench. Their bench?

She approaches slowly, afraid he'll disappear like a mirage. But he becomes more solid with each step—worn maintenance uniform, paint-stained hands, shoulders curved inward like he's protecting himself from being seen.

"Hale?"

He turns, and twenty months collapse. His face is exactly as she remembers—sharp features, pale eyes, the mouth that told her about Swedish winters while water rose around them. Real. Solid. Here.

"You can see them," he says. "The messages."

"I see something. I don't know what I'm seeing. I might be—"

"You're not crazy." His voice is certain, gentle. "What you see is real. I can prove it."

He holds up what looks like a pen but isn't. When he draws in the air, it leaves a trace—that shimmer-substance, visible only at certain angles, in certain light.

"What is that?"

"UV paint. Invisible to most people. But you—" He looks at her with something like reverence. "You can see it without special light. Do you know how impossible that is?"

"Everything about me is impossible."

"No. Everything about you is just rare. So rare that people call it wrong instead of wonderful."

He draws something on the bench between them—the exact pattern she'd arranged with pencils two years ago, before the flood, before him, when she was just a weird girl with wrong eyes.

"You've been watching me."

"You've been answering. Every pattern you made, I painted. Every painting I made, you responded to. We've been having a conversation, Chloe. We just didn't know it."

She wants to believe him. Wants to believe she's special, not sick. But twenty months of therapy, of being told her perceptions are symptoms, of doubting everything she sees—

"Tomorrow," he says. "2 PM. The tower. I'll show you everything. Every painting, every message, every impossible thing you see. And you'll know—really know—that you're not crazy. You're miraculous."

He stands to leave, and panic flares.

"Don't disappear."

He smiles—sad, beautiful, real. "Never again. We're done being invisible."

As he walks away, Chloe sits on the bench surrounded by shimmer-writing only she can see, holding vinyl fragments that prove either her sanity or her madness, waiting for tomorrow when she'll finally learn which one she is:

Crazy or miraculous.
Sick or special.
Alone in her delusions or connected to someone who sees her impossible frequency.

The answer waits in the tower at 2 PM, when the light will reveal everything.
