# Chapter 4: Power Failure
*January 9, 2023 - 7:47 PM*

The lights die without warning.

One moment Chloe is staring at her laptop screen, cursor blinking on a blank document titled "Essay on Color Theory" that she'll never write, and the next, darkness swallows everything. Complete black. The kind her eyes rarely experience—even darkness has colors for her, usually seventeen shades of gray-purple-blue. But this is different. This is absence.

Then, emergency lighting kicks in.

Harsh. UV-reactive. Revealing.

The library walls explode with light.

Not regular light—patterns, words, spirals, entire murals invisible in normal spectrum suddenly blazing to life. Every surface Chloe thought was blank is covered in art. Intricate, deliberate, obsessive art. And she can see all of it, every layer, every color that shouldn't exist.

"Holy shit," someone gasps nearby.

"What is that?"

"Is that... paint?"

But Chloe sees more than paint. She sees conversations. The spirals match her pencil arrangements. The words—Swedish, she thinks—appear near places she regularly sits. The patterns respond to patterns she's created, like call and response, like question and answer, like—

"You can see them?"

The voice comes from behind her. She turns.

It's him. The maintenance worker with the dyed-black hair, seventeen different blacks now that she's looking directly. He's holding a flashlight but not using it, standing in the emergency light like someone caught mid-crime or mid-miracle.

"You're the one who—" Her voice catches. "How long have you—"

"Months." His accent is slight, Swedish bleeding through American English. "You've been arranging colors in response. I thought I was imagining it, but—"

"I thought I was going crazy."

"No." He steps closer, and she can smell rain on him, industrial cleaner, and something else—paint. UV paint. "You were having a conversation."

Around them, other students pull out phones, trying to capture what they're seeing, but Chloe knows the cameras won't catch it all. They can't see what she sees—the depth, the layers, the way some paint is older, weathered, and some is fresh, maybe hours old.

"Why?" she asks.

"I wanted to create something only certain people could see. Like—" He stops. Swallows. "It doesn't matter now."

"It matters." She doesn't know why she says it, but it feels true. Essential. "It's beautiful."

Thunder crashes overhead. The building shakes. Through the windows, she can see the lagoon—usually peaceful, now churning, rising, already over its banks.

"We need to move," he says. "The water—the first floor will flood."

"How do you know?"

"2018. I was here. Different job, same storm pattern. This is worse. Much worse." He looks at her laptop, her arranged pencils. "Bring what matters."

She grabs her bag, her pencils—why the pencils?—and her phone. Around them, students are laughing, taking selfies with the UV art, not understanding the danger. The rain sounds wrong—too heavy, too fast, like the sky is falling in liquid form.

"Everyone needs to get to higher ground," Hale calls out. "Now. Third floor minimum."

"Who are you to—" some guy starts.

The windows on the first floor blow in.

Water doesn't creep—it charges. Black water, filled with debris, pushing through the broken windows like the ocean has come to claim the land it always wanted. The sound is catastrophic—glass, screaming, the building groaning.

"MOVE!" Hale shouts.

Chaos. Students running, pushing, crying. The emergency lights flicker but hold. In the strobing light, Chloe sees more UV paint—arrows pointing to exits, to stairs, to safety. He'd painted escape routes.

"You knew," she says, following him up the stairs. "You prepared for this."

"I prepare for everything. Habit from—" He stops again. They're on the second floor now, but water is already at the first-floor ceiling. "Doesn't matter."

"Tell me."

He looks at her in the harsh emergency light. His eyes are blue—but she sees nine different blues, each telling a different story of sadness.

"I went to prison for something I didn't do. When you've lost everything once, you prepare for losing it again. So I painted escape routes. I painted beauty that could only be seen in disaster. I painted for the end of the world."

"And I've been answering you."

"Yes."

The building shudders. Water is finding ways in they hadn't imagined—through ventilation systems, up through drains. The second floor won't hold.

"The tower," he says. "Storke Tower. It's tall enough. Solid enough."

"That's across the lagoon."

"Not anymore. The lagoon is everywhere now."

They reach a window. He's right. The lagoon has consumed the paths, the gardens, everything. It's not water anymore—it's a living thing, angry, hungry, rising.

"Can we make it?"

He looks at her, really looks at her for the first time. "What's your name?"

"Chloe."

"Chloe." He says it like he's tasting it. "I'm Hale. And yes, we can make it. I've been mapping this campus at night for years. I know every route, every elevation, every—" Lightning illuminates everything, and for a moment she sees the full scope of his UV paintings extending beyond the library, covering walkways, buildings, trees. "I painted the safe paths. Can you see them? The green-white ones?"

She looks. Yes. Through the rain, through the chaos, she can see UV paint glowing on raised walkways, on building sides, creating a map only visible in emergency light, only visible to eyes like hers.

"I see them."

"Then follow me. And Chloe?"

"Yeah?"

"When we get to the tower, when we're safe, I need to tell you something."

"Tell me now."

He shakes his head. Water is at the second-floor windows now. "Not yet. Not until we're somewhere the water can't reach."

They run into the storm, following invisible paths painted by a man preparing for disaster, seen by a woman who can perceive impossible colors. Behind them, the library floods completely. Ahead, Storke Tower rises like a promise.

The rain tastes like endings. But underneath, barely detectable, Chloe tastes something else.

Beginnings.

The power is out across campus now. Only emergency lights remain, making the whole university look like Hale's canvas—covered in UV paint that tells stories of safety, beauty, and obsessive love for someone he'd never met but had been talking to for months.

They run through his illuminated world, toward the tower, toward truth, toward whatever confession waits above the rising water.

Lightning flashes. She sees him clearly—rain-soaked, determined, beautiful in his strange purposefulness. He looks back at her, and for a moment, she sees what her tetrachromacy has been trying to tell her all along.

He doesn't have an anxiety color because he's already survived his worst fear. He doesn't glow with worry because he's made peace with disaster.

He's the color of after—what remains when everything else washes away.

"Keep running," he shouts over the storm. "We're almost there."

Almost where? The tower? Safety? Or something else—the place where pretense drowns and only truth can breathe?

The water rises. They run. Above them, the tower's emergency lights create a beacon.

They're going to make it.

They have to.

Because this conversation that started in invisible paint needs to continue in actual words, in the space above catastrophe, in the place where the water stops rising.
