# Chapter 2: The Last Normal Day (Enhanced with Artistic Connection Foreshadowing)
*January 8, 2023 - The Day Before*

The lagoon looked beautiful that last normal evening, but wrong—like someone had painted it with colors that didn't match reality. 

Chloe sat on her bench, the one with the perfect view, arranging her colored pencils in a pattern that felt urgent, necessary, like responding to a question she couldn't quite hear. Seafoam to sage to forest to emerald, but with seventeen micro-gradations between each major shift. Her hands moved without her conscious control, creating spirals that reminded her of music she'd never heard.

"Still at it?" 

Marcus had appeared beside her, careful not to disturb the arrangement.

"It calms me," she said, which was only partially true. The real truth was that lately, arranging colors felt like conversation. Like call and response. Like someone, somewhere, was waiting for her to get the pattern exactly right.

"Weather's getting weird," Marcus said, and she looked up to notice the light—gold with too much green bleeding through, purple shadows where there should be blue. The sunset looked painted by someone who could see spectrums that shouldn't exist.

"Maybe you should head home," Marcus suggested.

"I have a paper to write. Library's open until midnight."

But that was a lie. She'd been spending nights in the library because certain corners made her feel less alone. Not the popular study areas—the forgotten spots, the places that felt like someone had been there recently, leaving invisible warmth behind.

After Marcus left, she noticed movement across the lagoon. Maintenance staff working late, including the tall one she'd been unconsciously tracking for months. He moved differently than the others—deliberate, like each gesture was painting something in the air. She'd started timing her library visits to catch glimpses of him, though she couldn't explain why.

Tonight he was doing something strange—touching walls as he passed, pressing his palm flat against concrete pillars, standing back to look at empty spaces like they held secrets. Once, she saw him pull something from his pocket—a pen?—and make quick movements against a wall, though from this distance she couldn't see if he was actually writing anything.

Then he looked up. Straight at her. Across the impossible distance of the lagoon, their eyes met.

The air between them shimmered—actually shimmered, like heat waves but in January, creating patterns that made her tetrachromatic vision sing. She saw colors bounce between them that had no names, frequencies that shouldn't exist in nature. Her hand moved involuntarily, rearranging pencils to match the shimmer pattern.

He tilted his head, watching her arrange. Then—and she would swear this later, though it seemed impossible—he pulled out his pen and made movements in the air that exactly mirrored her pencil arrangement. Like he was painting her pattern in invisible ink.

A maintenance golf cart pulled up, breaking the moment. He turned away, but not before she saw him touch the pillar one more time, deliberately, like leaving a message.

After he'd gone, she couldn't concentrate. The pencil arrangement seemed to pulse with meaning she couldn't decode. She gathered her things and headed to the library, but took a detour past the pillar he'd touched.

Nothing visible. But when she pressed her palm where his had been, the concrete felt different—warmer, despite the cooling evening. And when the setting sun hit at just the right angle, she could swear she saw something shimmer on the surface. Letters? Symbols? Colors that shouldn't exist on gray concrete?

In the library, she gravitated to her corner—third floor, northwest section. It always smelled faintly of something chemical here, like paint or permanent markers, though she'd never seen anyone drawing. Tonight the smell was stronger, fresher. 

She arranged her pencils on the desk, recreating the pattern from outside but adding to it—responding to something, building on a theme she couldn't consciously identify. The arrangement looked like music made visible, like a response to a song only her eyes could hear.

At 9 PM, her phone buzzed. Mom: "Storm's getting bad. Come home."

She typed back: "Staying with friend near campus. Safer than driving."

Another lie added to the pile. But something kept her here—the chemical smell getting stronger, the patterns in her peripheral vision that disappeared when she looked directly, the feeling that someone was trying to tell her something in a language she almost understood.

The lights flickered once. In that split second of darkness and return, she saw them—marks on the walls that weren't there in normal light. Paintings? Writing? They vanished when the lights steadied, but her eyes retained the afterimage: spirals and words and colors that perfectly matched the arrangement she'd just created.

She stood, heart pounding, and walked to the wall. Nothing visible. But when she touched it, her fingers came away with the faintest shimmer of something—paint? But not normal paint. It only showed when she held her hand at exactly the right angle, when the light hit just so.

The rain started then—heavy, wrong, carrying its own strange colors. She looked out the window and saw him again—the maintenance worker, now standing in the rain, looking up at her window. He raised his hand, and she mirrored the gesture without thinking. For a moment, the three floors between them collapsed into nothing, and she felt like they were having a conversation in frequencies nobody else could perceive.

Lightning flashed. In that brilliant second, the entire campus lit up with patterns—every surface he'd touched glowing with invisible paint, creating a map, a message, a massive art installation visible only in the spaces between light and dark.

Then darkness again. When her eyes adjusted, he was gone.

She stayed in the library, arranging and rearranging her pencils, feeling like she was answering questions written in invisible ink. The rain hammered harder. The lagoon began to rise. And somewhere on campus, she knew—without knowing how she knew—that someone was painting responses to her arrangements, creating art in frequencies that would only become visible when the world shifted into emergency lighting.

Her last normal evening ended with her creating the most complex pattern yet—ninety-three different colors arranged in spirals that seemed to pulse with meaning. She photographed it, though she knew the camera wouldn't capture what she saw. 

As she finally prepared to leave, the lights flickered again—longer this time. And in that extended darkness, she saw it clearly: her pencil arrangement painted on the ceiling in UV paint, perfect in every detail, signed with a single word in what looked like Swedish.

The power died completely then. Emergency lighting kicked in.

And the invisible conversation finally became visible.

The walls were covered—not just her corner but spreading outward like infection or invitation—with paintings that matched every arrangement she'd made for months. Her patterns reflected back in impossible colors, transformed into art by someone who'd been watching, responding, creating a dialogue she hadn't known she was part of.

She ran her fingers over the nearest painting. Still wet. He'd been here minutes ago, maybe less. Painting her patterns while she created them, simultaneous communication in different mediums.

The rain became a roar. The building shuddered. And Chloe understood with sudden clarity: she needed to find him. The tall maintenance worker with deliberate movements. The one who painted in frequencies only she could see. They'd been calling to each other for months without knowing it, and now the flood was coming to make their invisible visible.

She ran from the library into the storm, following the UV paint that now glowed everywhere—arrows, words, patterns—all leading to the same destination.

Storke Tower. The highest ground on campus.

Where someone was waiting who'd been painting her language all along.
