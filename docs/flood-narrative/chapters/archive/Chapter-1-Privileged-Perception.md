# Chapter 1: The Return (Privileged Perception Rewrite)
*September 2024*

The stall door blazes with hooked letters. Swedish maybe—those little crowns floating above the vowels. The paint is fresh, still tacky when Chloe touches it, but the words shimmer like they're drowning.

In the next stall, someone's crying. That sophomore from orientation—Emma? The toilet flushes. Footsteps approach the sinks.

Chloe's hand rises to the door latch. She could ask. Point. Say *look*.

She lets it fall.

Emma won't see it.

The water runs. The paper towel dispenser grinds. Emma leaves, and Chloe photographs the door. Through the screen: plain blue paint. Nothing. But when she looks directly, the letters pulse with their own light, spelling something that tastes like copper and snow.

*Försvinn inte.*

Her hands start their ritual—paper towels from the dispenser, arranging them by shade on the counter. Seventeen whites. Always seventeen lately, though the number feels like answering a question nobody asked.

Outside, UCSB thrums with September return. New eucalyptus where the giants drowned. Fresh paths that hurt to look at—something about the concrete vibrates wrong, makes her teeth ache.

"Martinez."

Brad Hutchinson blocks her path. Still watches her chest before her face, but his hands shake now. Different. Diminished.

He shoves a folder at her. "Your transcripts. From before."

"Why—"

"That boy. From the flood." His eyes dart to the library, the tower, back. "He asks about you."

The world tilts. 

"He's real?"

Brad's mouth twists. "Real as those things you see. Yeah, I know. Something's wrong with your eyes. Always has been."

He leaves before she can respond, but not before glancing at the bathroom door behind her. His gaze slides past the blazing letters like they're not there.

Because they're not. Not for him.

The maintenance cart by the library has a mark on its side—could be dirt, could be the number 2, depends on the angle. She follows its tire tracks. More marks appear in her peripheral vision—arrows that vanish when she looks directly, fragments that might be Swedish or might be nothing.

Third floor, northwest corner. Her old spot. New furniture but something's off—the wall shimmers like heat mirages in September AC. She touches it. Her fingers come away glowing.

No. Not glowing. Something else. Something that exists in the space between visible and not.

Her phone buzzes. Unknown number.

"You see them."

Not a question. That accent—Swedish, careful, like testing if words still work.

"I see something."

"Look up."

Three floors above, a figure in the window. Backlit. Shoulders curved inward like he's protecting himself from being seen.

"The tower," he says. "Tomorrow. 2 PM. When the light—" A pause. "I'll show you what you're seeing."

The line dies.

She sits in the library surrounded by students with normal eyes reading normal things. The marks on the walls pulse in her peripheral vision. Messages or madness. She can't tell anymore.

Her therapist says trauma creates false patterns. Makes you see connections that aren't there. 

But the vinyl fragment from the library shelf is real—she's holding it. Marcus saw it too. Said someone destroyed a valuable record to make it. 

The fragment has more marks, that same shimmer-writing. She tilts it, and words appear:

*Where the water stopped rising.*

A girl walks past, bumps Chloe's elbow. The vinyl falls. The girl picks it up, hands it back.

"Cool bookmark," she says, and walks away.

She didn't see the message. Just black vinyl. Nothing more.

Chloe presses the fragment between her palms until the edges cut. Real. The vinyl is real. But what she sees on it—

Tomorrow. The tower. 2 PM.

Either she's sick or she's something else.

Twenty months since the flood. Twenty months of searching for someone who might not exist, who painted things that might not be there, who saw her when everyone else saw wrong.

She stands to leave and notices—someone's been sitting on the opposite side of the bookshelf. Through the gaps between books, she catches glimpses: maintenance uniform, paint-stained hands, black hair with seventeen different browns showing through where the dye's grown out.

She moves around the shelf.

Empty. But the chair's still warm. Seventeen different warms when she touches it.

On the seat: another vinyl fragment. Fresh marks that smell like UV and secrets:

*Stop running. Start seeing.*

She turns slowly. The library looks normal except where it doesn't. Walls that shimmer. Paths that glow. A conversation happening in frequencies only broken people can hear.

Or only special people.

Tomorrow she'll know which.
