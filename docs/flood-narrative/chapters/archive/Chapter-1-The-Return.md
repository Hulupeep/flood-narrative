# Chapter 1: The Return
*September 2024*

Things started to peel away. Not by choice.  Not by chance.  Chloe sits in Lot 32—same spot, different car and it's like bits of her are coming away.  She remembers to breathe. She closes her eyes. The rental smells wrong, like corporate cleaning products and someone else's life.  She can't get out, she can't stay. 

Twenty months since water swallowed her Honda, twenty months since the night that rewrote everything she thought she knew about color, connection, and what it means to truly see someone.

The campus looks almost the same. Almost. She forces herself out.

New eucalyptus saplings where the old giants drowned, their teenage bark still too smooth, too uniformly brown—something about them feels wrong, too simple, lacking the complexity the old trees had. Fresh concrete paths snake where the earth split open, their pristine gray jarring against the weathered walkways that survived. Cheerful signs about "Building Back Better" assault her eyes—something about the paint combinations makes her feel sick, like the colors are fighting each other, the whole campus radiating a visual discord.  

She's here to register. Finally. The transfer papers in her bag already feel like lies, dated for this quarter as if the last twenty months were just a pause, not a complete rewriting. As if she didn't spend them searching for a Swedish maintenance worker who vanished like his UV paintings in the flood.

The lagoon is drained. Construction equipment squats where water should be, yellow machines that hurt to look at—seventy-three different yellows where normal people see one, each shade shrieking a different warning. The absence of water feels wrong, like looking at someone without their skeleton.

She remembers this view differently.

*No. Don't go there. Not yet.*

But campus memories don't ask permission. The smell of torn earth and machine oil becomes the smell of wet eucalyptus and fear, and suddenly she's not in September's cruel sunshine but January's endless rain, watching the lagoon rise and rise and rise—

She forces herself back to now. To the rental car. To the registration packet. To the reason she's really here.

The UV paintings.

Maria had called three weeks ago. "Mija, you need to see something. Some of his work—it survived. Hidden under the eaves, protected places. But there's something else. New ones are appearing."

New ones.

Which means he's back. Somewhere. Invisible again but still painting, still leaving messages in a spectrum most people can't see.

Chloe reaches for the door handle and freezes. The metal seems to shimmer with heat—but not just one kind of heat. Multiple layers of warmth that remind her viscerally of his hand that night. Ever since the flood, she's been noticing these patterns everywhere, searching for that specific combination of warmth. She's never found it on another person.

A maintenance golf cart hums past. Her heart jackhammers—but the driver is too short, too old, too obviously not-Hale. She's been doing this for twenty months: seeing Swedish ghosts in every service uniform, searching for aurora borealis hidden under California sun.

The registration building looms ahead, its new automatic doors too eager, opening before she's ready. Inside, everything smells like fresh paint and denial. They've covered water damage with cheerful yellows—but something about the paint makes her nauseous, like it's vibrating at frequencies that create discord, each shade whispering *flood flood flood* in ways she can't explain.

"Chloe Martinez?" 

She turns. Brad Hutchinson stands there, her old SBCC counselor, but something's different. He's not wearing his usual leering smile. He looks... tired. Human.

"Brad? What are you doing at UCSB?"

"Transferred. After the flood, many of us did. Clean slate, you know?" He pauses. "I heard you were finally registering. I wanted to—I need to tell you something." He can't help his eyes quickly dropping  dropping to her breasts. Can't turn it off, she thinks.

"I have an appointment right now but maybe-"

"I kept copies,"   

"What?"

"Records.   When SBCC's servers flooded, everyone lost their transcripts. Except my students. I kept everything."

"Why?"

"I don't know. I just did. It's probably not all-"

"definitely not. Look-"

"I knew you'd come back. The real you, not the one pretending." He hands her a folder. "Your real transcripts. Including the courses you actually attended before... before you stopped. It's enough units to transfer. Barely, but enough."

"I don't understand. You hated me."

"I hated watching you waste yourself. There's a difference." He turns to leave, then stops. "That boy you were trapped with during the flood—the maintenance worker. He's been asking about you."

The world tilts. "Hale? You've seen Hale?"

"Different shift now. Days. But yeah, he's around. Painting weird stuff only certain people can see. Thought you should know."

Brad walks away, leaving Chloe holding her future in a manila folder, her past in her chest, and her present suddenly, impossibly, full of potential.

She looks down at her hands. They're arranging the papers by color without her conscious thought—the way they've been arranging things since she was small, the way they arranged things that night while water rose and death felt certain and a boy with seventeen different warms held her hand.

Outside, afternoon light slants across the campus. If she knows Hale—and she does, somehow she does—he'll be painting now. Somewhere the sun doesn't reach. Somewhere only she can see.

She has registration to complete. Forms to file. A future to claim.

But first, she has invisible art to find.
