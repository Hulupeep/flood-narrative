# Chapter 11: Testing Real vs. Trauma Bond (Enhanced with Synesthetic Descriptions)
*September 2024 - One Week After Reunion*

They're in the Marine Science Building, second floor lab that Dr. Tanaka has commandeered for their project. The afternoon light through the aquarium windows doesn't just cast blue-green—it sings it, each shade hitting Chloe's eyes like a different note in a chord she feels in her teeth.

Hale is mixing paints, trying to match what she describes. His concentration tastes purple in her mouth—not grape, but the purple of focused thought, like velvet against her tongue. She's been tasting colors more since they reunited, as if his presence amplifies her synesthesia beyond just vision.

"More yellow," she says, watching him work. "But not yellow-yellow. The yellow of anxiety but diluted. Like worry that's learned to swim."

"Is not color, that," he says, Swedish grammar slipping through.

"Everything's a color if you can see it. Your voice right now is amber-green, like honey mixed with mint."

He looks up sharply. "You see my voice?"

"Sometimes. When you're..." She pauses, embarrassed. "When you're looking at me like that."

"Like what?"

"Like I'm a color you've never seen before."

He adds a drop of cadmium yellow to the blue-green mix, and the color shifts. The change makes a sound in her head—a bell, but underwater, but also somehow like his laugh. Synesthesia on synesthesia, senses tangling into impossible combinations.

"There," she says. "That's it. That's what hope tastes like."

"Hope has taste now?"

"Your hope does. It tastes like that color sounds."

He marks it in the notebook: *Tank 7 ambient: CY-0.02, PG-0.4, Pearl-0.1, Base USG-3.* Their developing language, but she sees each notation as a different texture—rough, smooth, sharp, soft—depending on the color it represents.

"We're good at this, we are," he says, not looking at her.

"At making paint?"

"At working together. Has been week and we haven't—" He stops, starts again. "We function. Professional. Is productive."

The word 'professional' sounds gray-beige in her ears, the color of disappointment wrapped in politeness.

"Is that what you want? Professional?"

Now he looks at her. In this light, his eyes are more green than blue, but she can also see sounds in them—the echo of every Swedish lullaby he's never sung, the resonance of vinyl records spinning, the frequency of his heartbeat which she somehow knows is seventeen beats per minute faster than normal.

"I know not what I want," he admits. "For twenty months, I wanted finding you. Now you're here, and I'm terrified that if we—if we try being what we were that night—we discover it was just fear chemicals. Just trauma making connection."

"Trauma bonding." The words taste bitter, like burnt orange peel.

"Yes."

She sets down the color sample she's been studying—it's been humming against her palm, a frequency only she can feel. Walks to the window. Below, the campus continues its restoration. Students who weren't here for the flood walk paths that smell like forgetting—she can smell colors now too, since him, everything amplified.

"My therapist says trauma bonds fade," she says. "Once the danger passes, the connection dissolves. It's been twenty months. If this was just trauma—"

"We wouldn't still be here."

"But we didn't know. For twenty months, we were separated. We preserved perfect memory. Now we test if it's real, and I'm—" She turns to face him. "I'm scared too. Your fear tastes like copper and snow."

He sets down his brush, wipes his hands on a rag that's seventeen different colors but also seventeen different sounds—each paint stain resonating at its own frequency like a color orchestra only she can hear.

"What if we fail test?"

"Then at least we'll know. But Hale—what if we pass?"

They stand there, ten feet apart that feels like ten different distances simultaneously. The air between them has its own color—not quite visible, not quite invisible, but something her tetrachromatic eyes interpret as the visual equivalent of potential energy. It sparkles and hums and tastes like the moment before lightning.

"Is something I should tell you," he says.

"Another confession?"

"No. Or yes. Is kind of." He pulls out his phone, shows her a photo. A painting of his storage unit from memory, every record spine visible. But painted in colors that make sounds in her head—a visual symphony of loss and longing. "I painted this. Last month. Before you came back."

"It's beautiful. It sounds like grief in B minor."

"Look more close."

She does. In the corner, barely visible unless you know to look, is a figure. A woman arranging something—records?—by color. The pattern makes her mouth flood with the taste of her own tears, salty-sweet with recognition.

"You painted me. In your memory. In colors that sing."

"I painted you in everything. Every piece I make for twenty months has you in it somewhere. Hidden, like UV paint, but there. Because even when I thought never seeing you again, you were only audience I cared about."

"Hale—"

"No, let me finish. I'm terrified this isn't real. That we're two broken people who confused drowning for swimming. But I'm more terrified of not trying. Of spending rest of life wondering if what we felt in tower was most real thing that's ever happened to me."

She crosses the space between them—not running but deliberate, each step creating its own note in the symphony she hears when near him. When she reaches him, she doesn't touch, just stands close enough that she can taste his warmth—cinnamon and copper and that specific combination of seventeen temperatures that create their own color in her mind, a color she's named "home."

"The night of the flood," she says, "when water was rising and we thought we'd die—do you remember what you said? Right before the kiss?"

"That I'd been waiting for you whole life."

"And I said me too. But I was wrong." She sees him flinch, feels it as a discord in the visual music between them. "I wasn't waiting for you. I was waiting to be seen. Really seen. And you saw me—not despite my tetrachromacy but because of it. You painted for my eyes before knowing they existed."

"Chloe—"

"And I saw you. Not maintenance worker, not supposed extremist, not invisible man. I saw artist leaving beauty in frequencies only certain people could detect. We didn't find each other in flood, Hale. We'd already found each other. Flood just made us visible."

He reaches up, not quite touching her face, his hand hovering an inch away. She can feel the heat from his palm in seventeen different temperatures but also seventeen different colors, seventeen different sounds, seventeen different tastes. Her synesthesia explodes into combinations that shouldn't exist—she tastes the color of his hesitation, hears the texture of his hope, sees the sound of his breathing.

"So what we do? How we test if this is real?"

"We already are. Every day this week, we choose being here. No water rising. No death circling. Just us, making art, building language for impossible colors. That's test."

"Are we passing?"

She finally bridges that last inch, her hand covering his, pressing it against her cheek. Seventeen warms, just like always, but now she experiences them in every sense simultaneously—the warmth looks like sunset through honey, sounds like strings tuning, tastes like cardamom and safety, smells like rain on Swedish pine, feels like coming home.

"What do you think?"

He kisses her.

It's nothing like the flood kiss—that tasted like endings and looked like static. This tastes like beginning and looks like aurora borealis happening in slow motion behind her eyelids. She sees the kiss as colors that don't exist in nature—ultra-violet-gold-silver streaming through her vision like visible music. His mouth is soft but the kiss creates textures in her mind—velvet and electricity and the specific roughness of vinyl grooves.

When they part, she's crying, but the tears taste sweet—the flavor of relief mixed with recognition.

"So," he says, still holding her face, "professional colleagues?"

"Definitely not." The words come out tasting like laughter looks. "Your hands sound like seventeen different symphonies right now."

"What else you sense?"

She concentrates, letting her synesthesia fully unfold. "Your heartbeat looks purple-silver. Your breath smells like the color blue. Your voice when you say my name tastes like what I imagine northern lights would taste like—electric and ancient and impossible."

"Is too much? All this sensing?"

"No. It's like... like you're the only person who exists in as many dimensions as I can perceive. You're not overwhelming my senses—you're finally using all of them."

He kisses her again, and this time she catalogues every synesthetic response—his lips taste like the sound of rain, the kiss looks like music notation written in colors that shouldn't exist, his hands in her hair create patterns that smell like Swedish summers she's never experienced but somehow remembers.

"We're real," she says against his mouth, and the words create their own color between them—a new shade that needs a name.

"What color is real?" he asks.

She pulls back, looks at him—really looks with all her impossible senses firing at once. "It's the color of your voice saying my name. The taste of your paintings. The sound of seventeen warms. The texture of recognition. It's synesthesia for something that uses all senses at once."

"Need new word for that."

"We'll make one. We're good at making new words for impossible things."

They return to the paint samples, but everything's different now. They work closer, and she experiences him in surround-sense—every movement creating colors, sounds, tastes, smells, textures that prove he's real in more dimensions than most people know exist.

"Hey," she says, watching him paint a color that sounds like bells.

"What?"

"We're real. In every frequency. In every sense. In every impossible way."

He looks at her, and his smile tastes like the color happiness would be if happiness was a place you could live in forever.

"We're real," he agrees, and the words look like home.
