# The Shimmer at Thirty-Seven Degrees
*January 9, 2023, 2:00 PM - Before the Storm*

---

## Part 1: The Wrong Shimmer

The lagoon shimmers wrong.

Not the surface—that's just wind-rippled water catching afternoon sun. Underneath. In frequencies that make Chloe's teeth ache, like biting aluminum foil but translated to vision.

The bench calls to her at two PM sharp—same time every Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Ritual. Safety. The colored pencils demand arrangement in gradients only she can map. Forty-seven distinct shades from white to black, but that's the civilian count. Three hundred and twelve if you include what bleeds through at this angle, what normal eyes dismiss as shadow.

"That's obsessive, you know."

Brad drops onto the bench beside her. Smells like weed and disaster preparedness—he's been helping board up windows all morning.

"It helps me think," she says.

"About what?"

"Patterns."

"What patterns?"

She gestures vaguely at everything. The lagoon, the trees, the sky that's starting to look diseased around the edges—green-gold infection spreading from the horizon.

"You can't see them?"

"See what? It's just water and sky and—" He pauses. "Wait. Do you see that?"

Her heart jumps. "See what?"

"That shimmer. Like heat waves but... wrong."

"You see it?"

"No. Maybe. Fuck, I don't know." He rubs his eyes. "Been awake too long. Storm prep is making everyone crazy."

But he was looking at the right spot. The exact place where reality hiccups in frequencies she can't name.

"They're saying it'll be bad," he continues. "Like, historically bad. You evacuating?"

"No."

"Why not?"

Because the shimmer grows stronger each day—purple-silver wrongness that makes her teeth ache. Because someone leaves messages in paint that shouldn't exist. Because the storm isn't random weather, it's an answer to something, and she needs to know what question the universe is asking.

"Nowhere to go," she says instead.

"Parents?"

"Dead."

"Shit. Sorry."

"Long time ago."

They sit in silence. She continues arranging pencils. The pattern feels important—like she's responding to something. Always responding to something she can't quite see.

"Martinez!"

Marcus jogs up, board shorts and flip-flops despite the January cold and approaching catastrophe.

"Storm party at Sigma tonight. Epic end-of-the-world bash. You in?"

"The world's not ending," Brad says.

"Might be. Have you seen the weather models? This thing's a monster."

"It's just rain."

"Biblical rain. Forty days and forty nights rain. Build-an-ark rain."

Brad snorts. "Drama major?"

"Philosophy. But I appreciate theatrical truth."

Their argument fades to static. More important: the shimmer behind Marcus intensifies—purple-silver wrongness that tastes like electricity and sounds like silence screaming. Three weeks now. Always the same locations: library basement, third floor of humanities, the lagoon path. A route. Someone's route through campus. Someone who paints in frequencies that match her vision exactly.

"Can you see—" She stops. Points at the shimmer.

Both boys turn.

"See what?" Marcus asks.

"That... distortion. In the air."

They squint. Brad tilts his head.

"Maybe?" Brad says. "Like heat waves?"

"In January?" Marcus laughs. "Martinez, how high are you?"

"I'm not—"

"Hey, no judgment. Storm's coming. Get high, get laid, get enlightened. Whatever works."

He jogs off toward the dorms. Brad stays, still staring at where the shimmer dances.

"I might see something," he says quietly. "Or maybe you're making me think I see something. Power of suggestion."

"What does it look like to you?"

"Like... like the air is sick. If that makes sense."

It does. More than he knows.

---

## Part 2: The Pattern Maker

3:00 PM. Brad's gone to help with more storm prep. Chloe remains, pencils now arranged in a spiral that mirrors something she can't name.

"Extraordinary gradient."

The voice comes from behind. Accented. Swedish maybe—those careful consonants like English is formally learned, not naturally acquired.

She doesn't turn. In her peripheral vision where she sees most clearly, he resolves: tall, pale, pushing a maintenance cart that squeaks rhythmically. But he moves wrong for maintenance—too graceful, like the cart is costume.

"Just pencils," she says.

"Not just. Is answering something."

Her hands still. "Answering what?"

"Don't know. But every time I paint, you respond. Three months now. October, November, December. Always answering."

Now she turns. His face is angles and shadows, green eyes that are really forty-three different greens if she counts them all. Paint under his fingernails—seventeen different colors including some that shouldn't be visible in daylight.

"You're the one painting the invisible messages."

Not a question. She knows. Has known without knowing.

"Hale," he says. "And you're the girl who sees impossible things."

"Chloe."

"I know. Have been watching. Not—" He makes a gesture. "Not creepy watching. Curious watching. You see my work. No one else does."

"Your work?"

"UV paint. Special frequencies. Should be invisible unless—"

"Unless what?"

"Unless someone has eyes like yours."

She wants to ask what that means, but the storm pressure makes everything taste green-gold urgent, and there's something about the way he looks at her—not through her like everyone else, but at her, at what she actually is.

"Why?" she asks.

"Why paint invisible?"

"Yes."

He's quiet for a moment, organizing thoughts in what's clearly not his first language.

"In Sweden, we have word. *Ensamhet*. Means loneliness but more. Like—being only one who sees northern lights while everyone else sees empty sky."

"That's specific."

"That's my life. Until three months ago."

"What happened three months ago?"

"October third. I painted test on library wall. Message in UV. Next day, someone had arranged books to match the pattern. Exactly match. Impossible unless—"

"Unless they could see it."

"Yes. Was you, wasn't it?"

She remembers that day. Compulsive need to reorganize the study room books. Librarian yelled at her. But the arrangement felt necessary, like answering a question she didn't know had been asked.

"I didn't know why I did it."

"But you did it. You answered. We've been having conversation since. Me painting, you responding. Both thinking we're alone."

"But we're not."

"No. We're not."

Thunder rolls in the distance. Not close yet but coming. The air pressure makes her skin feel too tight.

"Storm will be bad," he says.

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"No. Will be worse than they think. I've been watching the water. The way it moves. Underground streams are already backing up. When rain comes—"

"Flooding."

"Catastrophic flooding. Starting from below."

"How do you know?"

"Maintenance. We see everything. All the systems. All the weak points." He pauses. "You should evacuate."

"Are you evacuating?"

"No."

"Then I'm not."

He almost smiles. "Stubborn."

"Practical. Where would I go?"

"Family?"

"Dead."

"Friends?"

"None who'd understand."

"Understand what?"

She gestures at the space between them where seventeen different temperatures create patterns only she can see.

"This. Whatever this is."

---

## Part 3: The Underground Gallery

4:30 PM. He shows her the basement.

Not the library basement—everyone knows about that. The maintenance tunnels beneath. Where pipes run and storage hides and UV paint covers every surface in messages no one else will ever see.

"How long have you been doing this?"

"Three years. Since I arrived. Scholarship for maintenance, but really I paint. Just... paint where no one looks."

"Why?"

"Why does anyone create? Because the images exist in my head and need to exist outside too. Because maybe someone, somewhere, has eyes to see. Because being invisible doesn't mean being nothing."

She runs her fingers along the wall. The paint has texture—raised in some places, smooth in others. Her fingers translate it to music, symphony in frequencies beyond hearing.

"This is beautiful."

"You can see it? Really see it?"

"Every color. Every layer. You painted this one first—" She points. "October maybe? Then added this November. This section is newest. Yesterday?"

"This morning. 4 AM."

"Why 4 AM?"

"Security shift change. Fifteen-minute window where no one watches."

"You've mapped their patterns."

"Have to. Wrong person sees me painting, asks questions. Visa is for maintenance, not art. They could send me back."

"To Sweden?"

"To nothing. Family doesn't— It's complicated."

She doesn't push. Understands complicated. Understands family that doesn't accept what you are.

"What does this say?" She points to Swedish words that pulse in seventeen different UV frequencies.

"*För någon som kanske känner.*"

"Which means?"

"For someone who might feel."

"Feel what?"

"The frequencies. The impossibility. The—" He struggles for words. "In Swedish, *Sväva*. To hover. Like northern lights. Between real and unreal."

"I know that feeling."

"I thought you might."

More thunder. Closer. The lights flicker—just for a second—but in that second, his UV paintings blaze brighter, like darkness makes them stronger.

"Power will fail," he says. "When storm hits fully. Emergency lighting runs on different spectrum. Will make everything visible."

"Everything?"

"Every message I've hidden. Every pattern. Every impossible thing."

"That sounds beautiful."

"Or terrifying. Depends who sees."

"Who would see? If people can't normally—"

"Some can. Partially. Under right conditions. Emergency lighting, thirty-seven degree angle, extreme stress—sometimes eyes do impossible things."

"Speaking from experience?"

"My mother. She could see... not everything. But enough. Enough to know I was different. Enough to be afraid."

"Afraid of what?"

"Colors that shouldn't exist. Patterns that suggest meaning where meaning shouldn't be. Her mind couldn't reconcile it. So she chose not to see me at all."

The weight of that sits between them. Chloe thinks of her own mother—different story, same ending. Parents who couldn't handle children who see too much.

---

## Part 4: The Storm Warning

5:45 PM. They're back at ground level. The library is emptying—evacuation officially starts at six.

"You really should go," Hale says.

"Already told you. I'm staying."

"Is dangerous."

"So is being alone with what I see."

He looks at her sharply. "What do you mean?"

"I mean—" How to explain? "My whole life, I see things others don't. Colors that shouldn't exist. Patterns that make no sense. Everyone thinks I'm crazy or traumatized or genetically broken. But you— you create the things I see. Which means either we're both crazy—"

"Or we're both something else."

"Yes."

"What do you think we are?"

"I think we're evidence that visible isn't everything. That reality has more frequencies than most people can perceive. That being different isn't being wrong."

He's quiet for a long moment. Then pulls out a UV marker.

"Give me your hand."

She extends it. He writes something on her palm. In normal light, nothing visible. But she sees it perfectly—seventeen different UV shades spelling out words:

*Du är inte ensam.*

"What does it mean?"

"You are not alone."

The words pulse with heat from his touch. Seventeen different temperatures that her brain translates to music, to color, to feeling she's never had before—being seen. Really seen.

"Where will you be? During the storm?"

"Working. Trying to protect the paintings. Some of them— I've been working on something. In Storke Tower. Highest point on campus."

"The carillon room?"

"Yes. If flooding comes, that's where I'll go. Safest place."

"Will I— will I see you again? After tonight?"

He looks at her hand, where UV words glow only for her eyes.

"If you want to."

"I want to."

"Then you will. When power fails, when emergency lights come on—look for my messages. They'll tell you where I am."

"Why not just tell me now?"

"Because—" He hesitates. "Because someone is looking for me. Someone who shouldn't find me. If they knew about you, about what you can see—"

"Who?"

"Doesn't matter. Just— be careful. Don't tell anyone about the paintings. About what you see."

"I never do."

"Good."

An announcement echoes through the building: "Library closing in fifteen minutes. All students must evacuate by 6 PM."

"I should go," she says.

"Where?"

"My dorm. Foster Hall."

"Third floor?"

"How did you—"

"I paint there sometimes. Outside your window. You arrange things on your windowsill that match my patterns."

"I do?"

"Every time. Like you're answering without knowing."

She thinks of all the times she's felt compelled to arrange objects, create patterns, respond to something she couldn't identify.

"We've been talking for months."

"Yes."

"Without knowing."

"Yes."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about this is impossible."

---

## Part 5: The Last Hour

6:00 PM. Library closed. Chloe walks back to her dorm through increasing wind. The rain hasn't started yet, but the air tastes like water—green-silver weight pressing down.

Emma intercepts her at the door.

"Thank god! I thought you'd left already."

"No, I'm staying."

"Are you insane? They're saying this could be the worst storm in decades."

"I'll be fine."

"Chloe—" Emma grabs her arm. "I know you're... different. See things different. But this is real danger."

"I know."

"Then why stay?"

Because someone else sees impossible things. Because the storm might make everything visible. Because for the first time in her life, she's not alone in her frequencies.

"I have my reasons."

Emma studies her. "Is it a guy?"

"What?"

"You have that look. That I-just-met-someone look."

"I don't have a look."

"You're literally glowing."

Chloe glances at her reflection in the window. Does look different—something in her peripheral vision, like she's resonating at new frequency. 

"It's nothing."

"Right. Nothing that has you staying during historic storm for no reason."

"Emma—"

"Fine. Keep your secrets. But at least come to the basement gathering. Safety in numbers."

"Maybe later."

Emma leaves, shaking her head. Chloe climbs to her room. Sits at her window. Arranges pencils on the sill without thinking—seventeen of them in pattern that mirrors something she can't see but feels.

Outside, the shimmer spreads. Not just the usual spots now—everywhere. Like the whole campus is shifting into different frequency. Like the storm is bringing visibility to invisible things.

Her phone buzzes. Alert from the National Weather Service:

CATASTROPHIC FLOODING EXPECTED. SEEK HIGHER GROUND. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

She looks at her palm. The UV message still glows:

*Du är inte ensam.*

You are not alone.

Thunder crashes directly overhead. The lights flicker—longer this time. For three seconds, darkness. Then emergency power kicks in.

And in that moment, she sees it—every UV message Hale has painted, suddenly visible in the emergency lighting spectrum. The entire campus covered in invisible art, all of it pulsing, calling, saying the same thing in hundred different ways:

*Find me.*

*Find me.*

*Find me.*

The rain begins.

---

## Part 6: The Incident 

7:15 PM. Vons parking lot on Hollister. Emergency supplies run before the storm hits hard.

The supermarket buzzes with disaster energy—people buying water, batteries, anything canned. Chloe loads bottled water into her cart, noting how the fluorescent lights make everything seventeen different kinds of harsh. Her brain automatically maps the spectrum: cool white LED mixed with aging fluorescent, creating frequency discord that tastes like metal.

She's walking to her car when she hears it.

Swedish radio. Tinny through someone's car speakers—folk music, maybe, with that particular Nordic melancholy she recognizes from her music theory classes. The melody drifts across the parking lot, and she follows the sound without thinking.

Hale doesn't see her.

He's focused on backing out of his space, head tilted toward the radio, one hand on the wheel, the other adjusting something she can't see. His old Toyota Corolla reverses slowly—too slowly, like he's listening more than looking.

The motorcycle parked beside him is beautiful. Matte-black Honda CB500. Owner nowhere in sight.

It happens in slow motion:

The soft plastic scrape of bumper against bike.

Hale's head turns toward the sound, but the radio's chorus swells—something about "himlen" that pulls his attention back. He adjusts the volume, hums along, continues backing.

Twenty feet away, through the glass doors, Chloe sees the bike's owner emerge from the store. Gavin Keane, though she doesn't know his name yet. MBA student, campus events crew, privilege masquerading as competence. He's juggling energy drinks and his phone, typing something urgent.

He stops. Stares. Pulls out his phone again.

Not to call—to film.

The bike has a small scuff on the black plastic fairing. Barely visible unless you're looking. But Gavin circles it like evidence, recording the damage from multiple angles. Gets Hale's license plate as the Toyota disappears into traffic, Swedish folk music fading with the taillights.

Chloe approaches. "Excuse me? Are you—"

"Did you see that?" Gavin interrupts, not looking up from his phone. "Guy just hit my bike and drove off. Classic hit and run."

"It was barely a tap. No real damage—"

"Are you kidding? Look at this." He points to the scuff. In normal light, it's nothing. But Chloe's enhanced perception reads seventeen different layers in the black paint, sees exactly where the plastic compressed and recovered, measures the impact at roughly 0.3 mph.

"It's cosmetic. Insurance won't—"

"Insurance isn't the point." He's already typing. Discord, WhatsApp, Instagram. Social media revenge in real-time. "People think they can just... disappear. Not anymore."

He films himself explaining the "incident," making it sound worse with each retelling. By the fourth version, the tap becomes a "significant impact." The scuff becomes "extensive damage."

Chloe watches him transform minor contact into major grievance. Watches him discover power in outrage, authority in victimhood. This is how rumors start, she realizes. Not from malice but from the intoxicating democracy of digital complaint.

"You got his plate?" someone asks. Gavin shows the phone screen. Clear shot of the license number, timestamp, GPS coordinates.

"Already running it through DMV lookup," Gavin says. He has an app for that. Of course he does.

Thunder rolls across the parking lot. The rain intensifies from shower to downpour. People run for their cars, abandoning shopping carts, prioritizing dry over orderly.

Chloe hurries to her Honda Civic, but as she drives away, she can see Gavin in her rearview mirror. Still filming. Still explaining. Still building his case against a stranger who was listening to Swedish folk music and never knew he'd made an enemy.

She doesn't think about it again until much later. Until after the flood. Until after the accusations start flying and she realizes that some disasters begin with the smallest contact—plastic against plastic, privilege against invisibility, the moment when someone decides to make a stranger's mistake into their own crusade.

But that's later.

For now, she just drives home through the growing storm, Swedish melody still stuck in her head, not knowing she's witnessed the first domino falling in a chain reaction that will nearly destroy the man she hasn't met yet.

---

## Part 7: The First Rising

7:30 PM. The rain isn't normal.

Not just volume—though it's already overwhelming the gutters, creating waterfalls where there should be drains. It's the quality. Dense. Aggressive. Like the sky is trying to return the ocean it borrowed.

Chloe stands at her window watching the campus transform. The shimmer she's been seeing for weeks intensifies with each lightning strike. In those brief, brilliant moments, she sees the UV messages clearly—trails of paint leading from building to building, all converging toward Storke Tower.

Her phone rings. Maria.

"Where are you?"

"My room."

"Are you insane? They're evacuating the dorms. Water's already coming up through the basement."

"From below?"

"Yeah, weird right? Pipes backing up or something. You need to get out."

"Where is everyone going?"

"Higher buildings. Campbell Hall, the Tower—anywhere above third floor."

The Tower. Where Hale said he'd be.

"I'll head there."

"Now, Chloe. This is serious."

"I know."

She doesn't pack much. Jacket, phone, charger. The pencils—she needs the pencils, though she doesn't know why. They feel important. Seventeen of them, wrapped in rubber band.

The hallway is chaos. Students running, crying, dragging belongings. The emergency lighting casts everything in harsh white-blue, but underneath—UV messages on every wall. Hale's been here. Recent. Maybe minutes ago.

One message stops her:

*Följ värmen.*

Follow the warmth.

She doesn't speak Swedish but understands anyway. Puts her hand on the wall. Feels the temperature variations—seventeen different warms leading like breadcrumbs toward the stairwell.

"Martinez! Move your ass!"

Brad, soaking wet, helping evacuate stragglers.

"I'm going."

"Where?"

"The Tower."

"Good. That's where we're sending everyone. Highest ground on campus."

He doesn't see the UV paint. Doesn't see how it pulses brighter when she touches it. Doesn't see that she's following a trail only she can perceive.

But he sees something. Pauses. Looks at her strangely.

"You okay? You look... different."

"Different how?"

"Like you're... glowing? No, that's stupid. Must be the emergency lights."

But she feels it too. Something changing. The storm, the pressure, the electromagnetic charge in the air—it's affecting her vision. Making her see more. Deeper. Frequencies she's never accessed before.

"I have to go," she says.

"Be careful. This is going to get worse."

He's right. She can see it in the shimmer—probability waves showing water rising, buildings flooding, disaster approaching in colors that taste like metal and fear.

But also—in the seventeenth color, the one that's always been uniquely hers—she sees possibility. Connection. Someone waiting in the Tower who paints in her frequencies.

---

## Part 7: The Trail of Seventeen Warms

8:00 PM. Outside is apocalypse.

Rain hits horizontal, driven by wind that sounds like screaming. The lagoon has overflowed, water spreading across paths, through gardens, into buildings. But it's not just from above—Brad was right. It's coming from below too. Storm drains reversing. Underground streams breaking free.

Chloe follows the UV trail. It leads not on the main paths but through maintenance routes, covered walkways, places where someone who knows the campus intimately would travel.

Every few yards, a message:

*Fortsätt.*  
(Continue)

*Nästan där.*  
(Almost there)

*Jag väntar.*  
(I'm waiting)

She doesn't know Swedish but knows these words. Feels them in frequencies beyond language.

The trail leads to Storke Tower's base. The door is locked—electronic systems failed. But there's UV paint around the handle, still wet, forming arrow pointing to maintenance panel. She opens it. Manual override lever, painted with seventeen different UV colors.

She pulls it. Door opens.

Inside, darkness except for emergency strips along the floor. But the UV paint blazes like road map—spirals up the stairwell, messages on every landing:

*First floor: Flooded soon*  
*Second floor: Not safe*  
*Third floor: Higher*  
*Fourth floor: Almost*  
*Fifth floor: Here*

She climbs. Behind her, she hears water entering the building—not rushing but seeping, inevitable, finding every crack.

Fourth floor. The carillon practice room. UV paint everywhere—not just messages but full gallery. Three years of work covering every surface in invisible art.

But no Hale.

Arrow pointing up. To the carillon itself. The bell tower.

She climbs the final ladder. Pushes through the trap door.

---

## Part 8: The Tower Gallery

The carillon room is transformed.

UV paint on every surface—walls, ceiling, even the bells themselves. In the emergency lighting, it all glows, but she sees deeper layers. Three years of messages, patterns, images. All for eyes that might never see.

And in the center, Hale. Painting.

"You came."

"You knew I would."

"Hoped. Not knew."

Lightning strikes—close, maybe hitting the building. In that brilliant moment, every UV frequency becomes visible even to normal eyes. The room explodes with color.

"My God," she breathes.

"Is too much?"

"It's perfect."

She walks the perimeter, reading three years of invisible messages:

*For someone who might exist*  
*For eyes that see impossible spectrums*  
*For connection beyond visible*

"You painted all this before you knew I existed."

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because—" He sets down his brush. "Because I had to believe someone, somewhere, could see. Otherwise, why have these abilities? Why see and create in frequencies others can't perceive?"

"Genetic accident. Evolution. Random mutation."

"Maybe. Or maybe we're meant to find each other. People who exist in same impossible frequencies."

Thunder crashes. The building shakes. Through the windows, she sees water rising—already at second floor of nearby buildings.

"We're going to be trapped," she says.

"Yes."

"For how long?"

"Until water goes down. Hours. Maybe days."

"You planned this."

"No. But I prepared for it. Look."

He shows her supplies—water, food, emergency blankets. Everything needed to wait out a flood.

"You knew it would be bad."

"I suspected. The underground water, the storm drains—I monitor them. Part of my job. They've been wrong for weeks."

"Wrong how?"

"Backing up. Like something blocking them. University ignored my reports."

"Why?"

"Because I'm just maintenance. Invisible. No one listens to invisible people."

She touches one of his paintings. Still wet. The seventeen warms of his handprint still present in the paint.

"I see you."

"I know."

"No, I mean—I really see you. Not just the paint. You. The seventeen different temperatures you radiate. The forty-three greens in your eyes. The way you exist in spectrums others can't perceive."

"How?"

"I don't know. Genetics. Mutation. Gift. Curse. All of it."

He moves closer. Close enough she can map his heat signature without trying. Close enough to see the UV paint under his skin—he's been painting himself, she realizes. Messages on his own body in frequencies only she can see.

"What does it say?" She points to his forearm where UV words glow through his shirt.

"Which one?"

"There's more than one?"

He rolls up his sleeves. His arms are covered in UV tattoos—not permanent but painted, repainted, layered. All in Swedish:

*Ensam* (Alone)  
*Söker* (Searching)  
*Hoppas* (Hoping)  
*Hittat* (Found)

The last one is newest. Still wet. Added today.

"Found," she translates without knowing how.

"Yes."

"Found what?"

"You."

Lightning strikes again. The room blazes with impossible light. In that moment, she sees everything—not just his paintings but the probability waves they create, the potential futures spreading from this moment, the frequencies of connection that shouldn't exist but do.

"This is insane," she says.

"Yes."

"We don't even know each other."

"No."

"You could be—anyone. Dangerous. Delusional."

"Yes."

"I could be imagining all of this. Trauma response to the storm."

"Maybe."

"But?"

"But you see my paintings. And I see you seeing them. We exist in same impossible space."

Wind howls. Water rises. The tower becomes island in growing flood.

And in the emergency lights, surrounded by three years of invisible art finally made visible, two people who see impossible colors stand at the beginning of eight hours that will change everything.

"What now?" she asks.

"Now we wait. And paint. And see what frequencies we can create together."

He hands her a UV marker.

She takes it.

Begins to draw.

The conversation that's been unconscious for three months becomes conscious. The connection that's been invisible becomes visible.

The storm rages.

The water rises.

But in the tower, in impossible light, two people speak in colors that don't have names.
