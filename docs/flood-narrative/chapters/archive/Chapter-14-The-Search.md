# Chapter 14: Twenty Months of Searching
*February 2023 - September 2024*

## Part 1: Chloe's Search
*February 2023*

The UCSB campus is closed indefinitely. Chloe sits in her childhood bedroom in Montecito, surrounded by color arrangements that all feel wrong now—too organized, too controlled, missing the chaos that she now understands was conversation.

She searches online obsessively. "Swedish maintenance worker UCSB." "UV paint artist Santa Barbara." "Hale Lindqvist" (she'd finally gotten his last name from Tommy at the evacuation center, but before her parents pulled her away). Nothing. He's invisible online, just like he was in real life.

She finds the vinyl collecting forums. Username VinylViking805, last active January 7, 2023. The day before the flood. His collection posts are poetry—detailed reviews of black metal albums, philosophical discussions about analog versus digital, photos of records arranged by color in ways that make her tetrachromatic heart sing.

She creates an account: ColorSeeker93. Leaves messages on all his posts. "Looking for VinylViking805. Urgent. Please contact." No response.

*April 2023*

SBCC reopens with limited classes. Chloe tries to return but can't. Every corner reminds her of invisible paintings she can now almost see—residual UV particles her enhanced vision catches in certain light. She drops out officially, stops lying about attendance.

She takes a job at an art supply store in Carpinteria. Arranges paint tubes by a color system only she understands. Customers think she's artistic. She's actually creating half a conversation, hoping somehow he'll see.

Instagram becomes her gallery. She posts daily color arrangements with hashtags: #UVPainterSB #SeventeenWarms #Channel7 #FindingTheFrequency. Each post is a letter to someone who might never see it.

*August 2023*

Dr. Tanaka finds her through the tetrachromacy research she'd started before the flood. 

"You're the girl from the flood," she says when they meet at a coffee shop. "The one who was trapped with the Swedish man."

"You know about that?"

"Everyone in certain circles knows. A tetrachromat and a UV artist finding each other during a disaster? It's become almost mythical. Where is he?"

"I don't know. I've been looking—"

"Have you checked the night shift records at UCSB? Facilities management?"

Chloe's heart stops. "They have records?"

"They're rebuilding. They'll need their experienced staff back."

*December 2023*

The UCSB facilities office is helpful but bound by privacy laws. "We can't give out employee information," the manager says. "But I can tell you we've recalled most of our pre-flood maintenance staff for the reconstruction."

"Night shift?"

"Especially night shift. Construction runs twenty-four hours."

She starts driving to campus at night, parking in different lots, walking past buildings under construction. Looking for UV paint, for tall shadows, for seventeen different warms in the darkness.

She finds old paintings—protected under eaves, in covered walkways—faded but visible to her enhanced vision. Maps to nowhere. Messages in bottles. Love letters to an unknown audience that was always her.

*March 2024*

She starts painting. Not well, but persistently. Takes classes, learns techniques, tries to capture what she sees. Her instructor is baffled—"You're painting colors that don't exist," he says.

"They exist. You just can't see them."

She creates a series: "Invisible Frequencies." Ninety-three paintings, one for each shade of blue-green in the flood water. She can't get galleries interested—the colors look wrong to normal vision, muddy and strange. But she posts them online, tags them carefully, hopes.

## Part 2: Hale's Search
*February 2023*

The storage unit is gone. Three thousand records, his entire history, reduced to silt and mold. Hale salvages what he can—the Botanist album, miraculously preserved; a few vinyl fragments; nothing else.

He doesn't return to UCSB immediately. Can't. Lives with Tommy for three months, paints houses for cash, tries to forget the feeling of seventeen different warms in a stranger's hand who wasn't a stranger at all.

But at night, he paints. UV paint on paper, regular paint on canvas, trying to capture what she saw. He doesn't know about tetrachromacy yet, just knows she could see ninety-three shades where he saw one. He paints ninety-three blues, gives them names: "Almost drowning," "Still breathing," "Her eyes in emergency lighting."

*May 2023*

UCSB calls. They need experienced maintenance staff for the reconstruction. Night shift, better pay, full benefits. He accepts immediately, not for the job but for the chance she might return.

First night back, he traces their path through the flood. The tower is gutted, under renovation. The carillon room where they confessed everything is stripped to concrete. But he starts painting again—new UV messages in the rebuilt spaces. "Still here." "Channel 7 forever." "Looking for the color girl."

*October 2023*

He discovers tetrachromacy through a Reddit thread about unusual vision. The description stops his heart: seeing millions of colors where others see thousands. More common in women. Often mistaken for mental illness or attention-seeking.

He researches obsessively. Finds Dr. Tanaka's papers. Learns Chloe's full name from a flood survivor interview where she's mentioned briefly: "Chloe Martinez, 20, was rescued from Storke Tower after being trapped for eight hours."

He finds her Instagram the same night. ColorSeeker93. Hundreds of posts, each one a color arrangement that perfectly complements his UV paintings. They've been having a conversation for almost two years.

*January 2024*

The first anniversary of the flood. There's a memorial service on campus. He doesn't attend the official ceremony but paints all night—UV messages on every rebuilt surface. "One year since drowning." "One year since finding." "Come back."

He posts on vinyl forums for the first time since the flood, hoping she'll see: "VinylViking805 here. Lost everything in the flood except one record and the memory of someone who could see invisible colors. Still searching."

ColorSeeker93 responds within an hour: "Is this real? Is this you?"

But when he tries to respond, the message fails. Her account is deleted. Later, he learns her parents found her "obsessive online behavior" and intervened. The trail goes cold.

*June 2024*

Dr. Tanaka finds him through Maria, who mentions the UV painter still working nights. She brings printouts of Chloe's Instagram posts before they were deleted.

"She's been looking for you," she says. "She's created an entire color language based on your work."

"Where is she?"

"I don't know. But I'm applying for a grant to study tetrachromatic perception. If I get it, I'll need both an artist and a tetrachromat. Want to be the artist?"

"Only if you find her."

"I'll find her."

## Part 3: The Near Misses

They almost cross paths seventeen times during the twenty months:

1. *March 15, 2023*: Both at State Street market, two aisles apart
2. *May 3, 2023*: Her car passes his bike on Cabrillo Boulevard
3. *July 22, 2023*: Same beach, different times—she leaves as he arrives
4. *September 10, 2023*: Both at UCSB library, different floors
5. *November 2, 2023*: Same coffee shop, she's leaving as he enters
6. *December 24, 2023*: Midnight mass at the mission, opposite sides
7. *January 9, 2024*: Flood memorial, she decides not to go last minute
8. *February 14, 2024*: Art store where she works, he decides against entering
9. *March 30, 2024*: Same concert at SOhO, lost in the crowd
10. *April 17, 2024*: Both hiking Inspiration Point, hour apart
11. *May 25, 2024*: Graduation day at UCSB, both there for different reasons
12. *June 8, 2024*: Farmers market, she's arranging flowers, he's buying fruit
13. *July 4, 2024*: Fireworks at the harbor, seventeen feet apart in darkness
14. *August 12, 2024*: Museum of Art, viewing the same painting at different times
15. *August 20, 2024*: Her first visit back to campus, his day off
16. *September 1, 2024*: Both at the bookstore, psychology and art sections
17. *September 7, 2024*: The day before she returns for real, he's moved to day shift

Each miss is a small tragedy, but also proof they're orbiting each other, drawn by invisible frequencies that will eventually align.

## Part 4: The Finding

*September 8, 2024*

When Chloe finally returns to campus and sees fresh UV paint dated yesterday, she knows: he never left. He's been here all along, painting invisible messages, maintaining their conversation even when she couldn't respond.

When Hale gets the call from Maria that the color girl is back, he doesn't hesitate. Changes his shift schedule. Goes to the tower at 2 PM because that's when the light is right, when the UV paint glows even in daylight if you know how to look.

Twenty months of searching end with seventeen warms and the question they've both been carrying:

"Was it real?"

The answer is in every color arrangement, every UV painting, every near miss that proves they were always finding their way back to each other.

The search is over.
The real work—of love, of art, of making the invisible visible—is just beginning.
