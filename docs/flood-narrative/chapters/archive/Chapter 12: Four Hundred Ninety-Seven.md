# Four Hundred Ninety-Seven
*March 2023 to September 2024 - Parallel Paths*

## Month One: The Lists

Chloe prints every survivor list. Highlights Swedish names. Norwegian names. Anything that might be misheard as Hale or Lars or Lindqvist or Holstrom.

Nothing.

She arranges the papers by color—the white has twelve variants, her tetrachromacy finding differences in each printout. The arrangement makes a pattern. She photographs it, posts it on Instagram without thinking.

Somewhere across town, Hale sees it. Paints a response on a wall no one will notice.

They're already talking without knowing.

## Month Three: The Giving Up

[ONE double-encoded scene - therapy as searching]

"You're making progress," Dr. Chen says.

Chloe nods. She's learned to perform recovery. Agrees that the "maintenance man" might have been trauma hallucination. Says the right words about moving forward.

But her hands betray her—arranging Dr. Chen's pens by frequencies only she can see. The arrangement matches UV paintings she'll never know exist, painted last night by someone allegedly moving forward too.

"The obsessive arranging," Dr. Chen notes. "We should work on that."

"It helps me think."

What she doesn't say: It's not obsessive. It's responsive. It's one half of conversation she doesn't understand she's having.

## Month Six: The Scars

[Parallel structure without them knowing]

**Chloe's apartment, 2 AM:**
She can't sleep. Arranges everything she owns by color. Photographs each arrangement. Posts them to Instagram with no caption. Her followers think it's art project about grief.

It is.
But it's also beacon.
*Here I am. Find me.*

**Hale's studio, 2 AM:**
He can't sleep. Paints on his own skin—seventeen parallel lines with UV ink. Scars that commemorate something that might not have been real. 

Tomorrow he'll paint those same lines on canvas. On walls. On anything that holds still.

Seventeen lines that say: *I remember the seventeen warms.*

---

## Month Nine: The Almost

Chloe goes to UC Berkeley. Color perception lab. Dr. Martinez (no relation) studies tetrachromacy.

"Extraordinary," he says, watching her identify 307 distinct colors in what looks white to him. "We should publish this."

Publication means real name. Real name means findable.

But also means admitting she's been "hallucinating" UV messages. Seeing things that aren't there. They'll medicate her like they did her mother.

"I need to think about it."

She doesn't publish. Stays invisible. Stays lost.

Meanwhile, Hale applies to gallery showing. They want his real name. Legal documentation. Background check will reveal the old accusation (false but still there).

He withdraws application. Stays invisible. Stays lost.

Both choosing invisibility, thinking it's protection.
Both staying unfindable.

## Month Twelve: The Anniversary

[Free indirect - let grief bleed into narration]

January 9, 2024. One year.

The lagoon's been drained and rebuilt. Looks nothing like before. Chloe sits on new bench in old spot. Arranges pencils she doesn't need to arrange. The compulsion stronger today.

A couple walks by. Happy. Holding hands.

The boy has paint under his fingernails.

For one second—

But no. Wrong height. Wrong eyes. Wrong everything except the paint.

She photographs her arrangement. Posts it. Deletes it. Posts it again.

The pattern says: *One year. Still here. Still looking.*

---

## Month Twelve, Same Day, Different Location:

Hale stands in what was Storke Tower's carillon room. Rebuilt. No trace of flood.

He's painted something on the ceiling. Where they couldn't reach that night. Where another tetrachromat once painted "Love persists in frequencies beyond visible."

His addition: *Still true.*

He takes photo. Can't post it—no social media, too risky with false accusation shadow. But he prints it. Puts it in box with hundreds of others. Evidence of faith when faith runs out.

---

## Month Fifteen: The Near Miss

[Tick-tock pressure - but subtle]

Chloe has three hours between flights. Layover in Seattle. Sees art supply store. Goes in.

The cashier: "Someone was just asking about tetrachromatic-responsive paints."

"What?"

"Yeah, Swedish guy. Tall. Was here maybe twenty minutes ago."

Twenty minutes.

"Which way did he go?"

"Toward gates C."

She runs. Three hours to search gates C1 through C47. Sees twelve tall men. None have seventeen warms. None exist in right frequencies.

Flight boards. She has to go.

Twenty minutes that might have changed everything.

---

## Month Eighteen: The Acceptance That Isn't

She stops checking survivor lists.
(But keeps the printouts.)

Stops calling hospitals.
(But keeps the numbers.)

Stops arranging things.
(Except she doesn't. Can't. The patterns happen without permission.)

"You're doing so well," Emma says. "Really moving on."

Moving on. The words taste like copper lies. She's not moving on. She's learned to hide the searching. Make it invisible like everything else about her.

But every arrangement is still a beacon.
Every pattern still says: *Find me.*
Every color still searches for its answer.

---

## Month Twenty: Right Before

[BECAUSE can't find THEREFORE create art as beacon]

September 15, 2024. Three days before reunion.

Chloe arranges her entire apartment. Every object by color frequency. It takes six hours. The result makes no sense unless you have tetrachromacy. Unless you're looking. Unless you're him.

She photographs it. Posts it. Caption: "Still seeing impossible things."

First caption she's used in twenty months.

September 15, 2024. Same night.

Hale paints the library wall. Fresh UV. The message that will bring her back: *Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Find me where the water began.

First direct message in twenty months. 

The faith is about to pay off.

## What They Don't Know They Know

[The revelation neither sees yet]

Pull back. Look at their twenty months of parallel creation:

- Every arrangement she made
- Every UV painting he created
- Posted/painted within hours of each other
- Matching patterns
- Call and response
- Question and answer

They've been having the same conversation they started in the tower. Just in frequencies that take twenty months to recognize.

Tomorrow Maria will call about new paintings.
Day after, Chloe will return to campus.
Day after that, everything changes.

But tonight, they're still searching.
Still creating.
Still keeping faith in someone who might be dead.

That faith is about to become sight.

## EMOTIONAL BEATS ACHIEVED

✅ **The act of faith in continuing to create**
- Both making art as beacons
- Parallel creation without knowing
- Choosing invisibility that keeps them apart

✅ **Human moments of searching**
- Printing survivor lists
- The twenty-minute near miss
- Anniversary grief
- Performing recovery while still searching

✅ **Surgical technique use**
- ONE double-encoded therapy scene
- Parallel structure showing unconscious connection
- Free indirect for grief without wallowing
- Subtle tick-tock in airport near-miss

✅ **What we DIDN'T do**
- Repetitive searching scenes
- Over-explain the parallel patterns
- Wallow in grief
- Too many techniques per scene

**Result**: Twenty months of faith rendered through specific human moments—the near misses, the false acceptances, the unconscious conversation that keeps them connected even when they think they're alone.
