# Chapter 15: The Exhibition Planning (Enhanced Heat Level & Family Reconciliation)
*October 2024*

The Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara is closed to the public on Mondays, but Dr. Tanaka has connections. She's brought Chloe and Hale here to propose something ambitious—an exhibition scheduled for January 9, 2025.

They stand in the main gallery, and Chloe notices how Hale's hand keeps finding the small of her back—not possessive but grounding, like he needs to confirm she's solid. The touch sends heat spiraling through her in seventeen different patterns, each one a different shade of want she's still learning to name.

"We'll need more than color documentation," she says, trying to focus despite his thumb making small circles against her spine. "People need to understand story. Not just science of tetrachromacy but... us."

"Story of invisible frequencies finding each other," Dr. Tanaka nods, but she's smiling slightly, clearly noticing how they orbit each other like magnets.

Hale pulls out his notebook, and Chloe watches his hands—paint-stained, careful, the same hands that mapped her body last night in his apartment for the first time. They'd been taking it slow since the reunion, but yesterday something shifted. Maybe it was the successful paint matching, or the way he'd said her name in Swedish, but suddenly slow wasn't enough anymore.

"I have sketches," he's saying, but his voice is rougher than usual, and she knows he's remembering too. "From twenty months apart. Every UV painting documented."

His arm brushes hers as he shows the notebook, and the contact makes her breath catch. Dr. Tanaka pretends not to notice, but Chloe sees her hiding a smile.

"Museum wants opening event. January 9th, evening," Dr. Tanaka says. "And there's something else—they want to commission permanent installation."

"We have idea," Hale says, and his hand finds hers under the table, fingers interlacing with casual intimacy that still feels new, electric. "Viewing station. Multiple panels of treated glass, each one filtering different light spectrums."

As he describes their vision, his thumb traces patterns on her palm—the same patterns he traced on her hip last night, when she finally let him see her fully, skin painted with colors only she could see, his mouth following the trails of impossible hues.

"I should go," Dr. Tanaka says eventually, clearly recognizing the tension. "You two can lock up. Security knows you're here."

After she leaves, the gallery feels smaller, more intimate. Hale turns to Chloe, and his eyes are dark, pupils blown wide.

"Been thinking about you all day," he admits, accent thicker when aroused.

"What kind of thinking?"

Instead of answering, he backs her against the wall—gentle but insistent. His hands frame her face, and he kisses her like he's been starving for it. She responds immediately, her body recognizing his seventeen warms and wanting more, always more.

"Someone could see," she gasps when his mouth moves to her throat.

"Gallery is closed. Cameras are off." His teeth graze her pulse point. "And I need—Chloe, I need—"

"What do you need?"

He pulls back, looks at her with those impossible blue eyes that she now knows turn green when he's inside her. "Need to know this is real. Still. Every day, I need to know."

She understands. Twenty months of separation has left them both with a desperate need for confirmation, for physical proof that they're together. She pulls him down for another kiss, this one slower, deeper, her hands tangling in his hair.

"It's real," she murmurs against his mouth. "We're real. Feel—" She takes his hand, presses it over her racing heart. "That's real. That's for you."

He makes a sound—half laugh, half sob—and kisses her again. This time there's heat building, the careful control of their first weeks together dissolving into something hungrier. His hand slides under her sweater, finding skin, and she arches into his touch.

"Not here," she manages. "Your apartment?"

"Is twenty minutes."

"Then we should go."

But neither moves, caught in the magnetic pull that's been growing stronger each day. Finally, he steps back, breathing hard, and she can see the effort it takes.

"Tonight," he promises. "After dinner with your parents."

She groans. "I forgot about that."

"Is important. They need to see I'm not dangerous extremist."

"They need to see you're man I love."

The word hangs between them—love. They haven't said it yet, not properly, not outside of desperate flood moments.

"You love me?" His voice is wondering.

"Hale Lindqvist, I see seventeen different colors in your tears. I taste your emotions. I can identify you by temperature alone. If that's not love, I don't know what is."

He crushes her to him, burying his face in her hair. "Jag älskar dig," he whispers. "Have loved you since you arranged pencils to match my invisible paintings."

## Later - Dinner with the Martinez Family

The Martinez house in Montecito smells like Chloe's childhood—her mother's mole, her father's cologne, the specific laundry detergent that makes her both comfortable and claustrophobic.

Hale is nervous, she can tell by how his Swedish accent gets more pronounced. He's brought flowers—not fancy ones but wildflowers he picked himself, arranged in gradients only Chloe can fully appreciate.

"So," her father says over dinner, "you're the maintenance worker from the flood."

"Facilities technician," Hale corrects gently. "But yes. Was me in tower with Chloe."

"And now you're... dating?" Her mother's tone is carefully neutral.

Chloe reaches for Hale's hand under the table. "We're together. We're working together too, with Dr. Tanaka. Documenting tetrachromacy."

"The color thing," her father says dismissively, and Chloe tenses.

But Hale squeezes her hand and speaks: "Not 'thing.' Is gift. Your daughter sees hundred million colors where most see one million. Is like—imagine if everyone else could only hear AM radio but she hears full spectrum. Would you call that 'thing' or miracle?"

Her parents exchange glances.

"Show them," Chloe says suddenly. "The paintings."

Hale pulls out his phone, shows them photos under UV light. Her parents lean in, fascinated despite themselves.

"You painted these?" her mother asks.

"For two years. Before knowing Chloe could see them. Was painting for ghost audience. Then found out ghost was real, was her."

"That's... romantic," her mother admits.

"Is more than romantic," Hale says, accent thick with emotion. "Is proof that connection happens even when people don't know they're connecting. Your daughter was responding to paintings she couldn't consciously see. We were having conversation in frequencies nobody else could hear."

Her father sets down his fork. "The therapist says you've been good for her. Says her anxiety is manageable now."

"She's good for me too. Makes me visible when I was choosing to be ghost."

"The arrest," her mother says carefully. "The extremism accusation—"

"Was false. Based on vinyl record I bought. But accusation remains online forever. Is why I understand Chloe's anxiety about being seen wrong. We both know what it's like when world decides who you are without asking."

There's a long silence. Then her father speaks: "You saved her. In the flood."

"We saved each other."

"And now?"

"Now we make art. Document impossible colors. Build language for things that don't have words."

Her mother watches them—how they unconsciously lean toward each other, how Chloe's anxiety visibly calms when he touches her, how he looks at her daughter like she's miraculous.

"The exhibition," her mother says finally. "We'd like to come."

"Really?" Chloe can't hide her surprise.

"Mija, we haven't understood you for years. The colors, the arrangements, the anxiety—it all seemed like illness. But if it's gift, if someone else sees it as gift..." Her mother tears up. "We want to understand. Want to see what you see."

"You can't see what I see. Nobody can."

"But he translates it, no? Your painter?"

Hale nods. "Is what I do. Take her impossible colors and make them visible for normal eyes. Not same, but... shadow of what she sees."

"Then we'll come," her father says firmly. "See our daughter's gift translated."

After dinner, on the porch, Chloe's mother pulls her aside while Hale helps her father with something in the garage.

"You love him."

Not a question.

"More than love. He sees me, Mom. Really sees me. Not the anxiety, not the lies I told about college, not the weird girl who arranges things obsessively. He sees the real me and thinks I'm miraculous."

"And the physical—" Her mother blushes. "You're being safe?"

Now Chloe blushes. "Mom!"

"I'm just saying, the way he looks at you, like he wants to devour you—"

"Mom, please."

"I'm happy for you, mija. Just... be careful. Love this intense can burn."

"Or it can illuminate."

Her mother hugs her. "Bring him for dinner every week. Your father likes him, I can tell. Says he has honest hands."

"His hands have seventeen different temperatures."

"Of course they do." Her mother laughs. "Nothing simple with you, even love."

## That Night - Hale's Apartment

They barely make it through his door before they're kissing, desperate and hungry after the tension of family dinner. His hands are everywhere—her hair, her waist, her hips—mapping her like he's painting her with touch.

"Was good tonight," he says against her throat. "Your parents—"

"Stop talking about my parents when you're doing that."

He laughs, lifts her, carries her to his bed which is really just a mattress on the floor surrounded by UV paintings. The room glows with invisible art made visible by strategic blacklights, and she feels like she's inside their conversation.

"Want you," she says simply.

"You have me. All seventeen warms."

They undress slowly this time, savoring instead of rushing. She traces the scar on his palm from the flood, kisses it. He maps the colors only she can see on her skin, following them with his mouth until she's gasping, arching, forgetting language except for his name.

When they come together, it's like completing a circuit—all their invisible frequencies suddenly synchronized, harmonizing, creating something that exists in spectrums nobody else can perceive.

After, they lie tangled, skin cooling in seventeen different patterns.

"The exhibition," she says. "We're really doing this. Making us visible."

"Scary?"

"Terrifying. But also right. We've been invisible too long."

He pulls her closer, kisses her temple. "In January, whole world sees what we see. But tonight, just us."

"Just us," she agrees, then shows him with touch and taste and impossible colors exactly what "us" means, their bodies creating art in frequencies that don't need paint or words, just skin and breath and the seventeen warms that always lead her home.
