# Chapter 11: Testing Real vs. Trauma Bond
*September 2024 - One Week After Reunion*

They're in the Marine Science Building, second floor lab that Dr. Tanaka has commandeered for their project. The afternoon light through the aquarium windows casts everything in blue-green that makes Chloe's tetrachromatic eyes sing—ninety-three distinct shades in the water alone, seventeen more in the way light bends through glass and liquid.

Hale is mixing paints, trying to match what she describes. They've been doing this for five days—her seeing, him translating, both of them carefully not touching since that first reconnection of hands in the tower. As if touching would answer a question they're not ready to ask.

"More yellow," she says, watching him work. "But not yellow-yellow. The yellow of anxiety but diluted. Like worry that's learned to swim."

"That's not a color."

"Everything's a color if you can see it."

He adds a drop of cadmium yellow to the blue-green mix, then something else—white? No, pearl. The paint shifts, and for a moment, it's almost right. Almost the color of the water in tank seven where the younger fish circle, not quite comfortable in their rebuilt world.

"There," she says. "That's it."

He marks it in the notebook: *Tank 7 ambient: CY-0.02, PG-0.4, Pearl-0.1, Base USG-3.* Their developing language, precise as chemistry but built on her impossible perception.

"We're good at this," he says, not looking at her.

"At making paint?"

"At working together. It's been a week and we haven't—" He stops, starts again. "We're functioning. Professional. Productive."

"Is that what you want? Professional?"

Now he looks at her. In this light, his eyes are more green than blue, picking up the aquarium's reflection. She can see the question he's not asking, the same one that's been lurking since their reunion: Was it real, or were they just two people traumatized into connection?

"I don't know what I want," he admits. "For twenty months, I wanted to find you. Now you're here, and I'm terrified that if we—if we try to be what we were that night—we'll discover it was just adrenaline. Just fear. Just—"

"Trauma bonding."

"Yes."

She sets down the color sample she's been studying, walks to the window. Below, the campus continues its restoration. Students who weren't here for the flood walk paths they don't know were underwater. Life moving forward while she and Hale circle each other like careful planets, afraid to collide.

"My therapist says trauma bonds fade," she says. "Once the danger passes, the connection dissolves. It's been twenty months. If this was just trauma—"

"We wouldn't still be here."

"But we didn't know. For twenty months, we were separated. We preserved the perfect memory. Now we have to test if it's real, and I'm—" She turns to face him. "I'm scared too."

He sets down his brush, wipes his hands on a rag that's already seventeen different colors from their work. "What if we fail the test?"

"Then at least we'll know. But Hale—what if we pass?"

They stand there, ten feet apart in a lab that smells like salt water and acrylic paint, surrounded by evidence of their compatibility—dozens of color samples he's matched to her impossible vision, notebooks full of their shared language, five days of proving they work together even without crisis.

"There's something I should tell you," he says.

"Another confession?"

"No. Or yes. Kind of." He pulls out his phone, shows her a photo. It's a painting—not UV, regular oils—of the storage unit he lost in the flood. But painted from memory with impossible detail, every record spine visible, each color she would have seen if she'd been there. "I painted this. Last month. Before you came back."

"It's beautiful."

"Look closer."

She does. In the corner, barely visible unless you know to look, is a figure. A woman arranging something—records?—by color. The pattern matches exactly the pencil arrangement she'd made that last normal day.

"You painted me. In your memory."

"I painted you in everything. Every piece I've made for twenty months has you in it somewhere. Hidden, like the UV paint, but there. Because even when I thought I'd never see you again, you were the only audience I cared about."

"Hale—"

"No, let me finish. I'm terrified this isn't real. That we're two broken people who confused drowning for swimming. But I'm more terrified of not trying. Of spending the rest of my life wondering if what we felt in that tower was the most real thing that's ever happened to me."

She crosses the space between them—not running but deliberate, each step a choice. When she reaches him, she doesn't touch, just stands close enough that she can see the paint under his fingernails, smell the industrial soap he still uses, feel the warmth that comes in seventeen varieties she's catalogued but never named.

"The night of the flood," she says, "when the water was rising and we thought we'd die—do you remember what you said? Right before the kiss?"

"That I'd been waiting for you my whole life."

"And I said me too. But I was wrong." She sees him flinch, starts to pull back, but she continues. "I wasn't waiting for you. I was waiting to be seen. Really seen. And you saw me—not despite my tetrachromacy but because of it. You painted for my eyes before you knew they existed."

"Chloe—"

"And I saw you. Not the maintenance worker, not the supposed extremist, not the invisible man. I saw the artist leaving beauty in frequencies only certain people could detect. We didn't find each other in the flood, Hale. We'd already found each other. The flood just made us visible."

He reaches up, not quite touching her face, his hand hovering an inch away like that moment in the tower before their first touch. "So what do we do? How do we test if this is real?"

"We already are. Every day this week, we've chosen to be here. No water rising. No death circling. Just us, making art, building a language for impossible colors. That's the test."

"Are we passing?"

She finally bridges that last inch, her hand covering his, pressing it against her cheek. Seventeen warms, just like always, but also something new—not desperation but decision, not fear but faith.

"What do you think?"

He kisses her.

It's nothing like the flood kiss—that was endings and desperation and thinking they'd die. This is beginning and choice and knowing they'll live. She sees colors behind her eyelids, but softer ones—not the neon explosion of adrenaline but the steady glow of recognition.

When they part, he's smiling in a way she's never seen—not the desperate smile from the flood or the careful one from their reunion, but something unguarded. Real.

"So," he says, still holding her face, "professional colleagues?"

"Definitely not."

"What then?"

She thinks about it, cycling through all the words—lovers, partners, survivors, artists—but none of them fit exactly. Then she remembers something from that night, something he'd said in Swedish.

"Själsfrände," she says, pronouncing it badly but trying. "Soul friends. People who understand each other's frequency."

"Your Swedish is terrible."

"Teach me."

"That could take years."

"Good."

They kiss again, and this time she lets herself catalog every sensation—the way his hands are steady now, not shaking like during the flood. The way he tastes like coffee and paint and something uniquely him. The way the colors behind her eyelids shift from blue to gold to something she's never seen before, something she decides to call "after the flood"—the color of finding that what you thought you'd lost was actually transformed, waiting, ready to become something new.

"We should get back to work," he says eventually.

"We should."

Neither moves.

"Dr. Tanaka will want progress reports."

"Definitely."

Still not moving.

"Or," she says, "we could accept that we've already passed the test. That every day we don't disappear, don't change the channel, don't retreat into invisibility, we're proving this is real. And maybe—maybe we could stop testing and start living."

He pulls back slightly, looks at her with those seventeen blues that she's painted in her mind a thousand times. "Together?"

"Together. Visibly. No more UV paint unless it's for art. No more hiding. No more waiting for disaster to make us real."

"That's terrifying."

"I know."

"Let's do it anyway."

They return to the paint samples, but everything's different now. They work closer, hands brushing as they reach for brushes. She describes colors and he translates them, but now they're also translating something else—twenty months of separation into presence, trauma into transformation, fear into whatever comes after fear when you decide to stay anyway.

The afternoon light shifts, the aquarium colors deepening as the sun angles lower. She watches him work, sees the concentration in his face, the way he's fully present in this moment, not hiding or preparing to run. 

"Hey," she says.

"What?"

"We're real."

He looks at her, sets down his brush, takes her paint-stained hand in his paint-stained hand. Seventeen warms, always seventeen, their constant in a world of variables.

"We're real," he agrees.

Outside, the campus continues its restoration. The lagoon refills. New buildings rise where old ones fell. Everything returning to normal but different, changed by the flood but not defined by it.

Inside, two people who found each other in disaster continue finding each other in ordinary Tuesday afternoon light, proving with every shared color, every matched paint sample, every careful touch, that some things weren't lost in the flood—they were revealed, refined, made visible and real and worth the twenty months it took to understand that drowning together was just the beginning of learning how to swim.
