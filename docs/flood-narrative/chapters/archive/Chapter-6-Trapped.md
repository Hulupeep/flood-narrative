# Chapter 6: Trapped
*January 9, 2023 - 10:00 PM*

The carillon room door slams shut behind them, swollen wood meeting warped frame with finality. Twenty-three students made it to the tower's upper floors—twenty below them in the eighth-floor classroom, Chloe and Hale here, one floor higher, separated by chance or instinct or the strange magnetism that makes people choose spaces together without planning.

"We should be with the others," Chloe says, but doesn't move toward the door.

"They're safe. Eighth floor is high enough." Hale stands at the window, watching water swallow the campus. "Higher than 2018. Much higher."

The emergency lights here are different—older, buzzing with a frequency that makes her teeth ache. They illuminate his UV paintings on the walls: coordinates, elevation markers, time stamps. He's been documenting floods that haven't happened yet.

"How long have you been preparing for this?"

"Since the last one. Since I got the job here. Since—" He turns from the window. In the harsh light, she can see him properly for the first time. Exhausted. Haunted. Beautiful in the way broken things are beautiful when they're still functioning. "Doesn't matter."

"Everything you say starts to matter then stops."

"Habit."

"From?"

He laughs—short, bitter. "From learning that the truth makes things worse."

Water slams against the building's base, the sound traveling up through concrete and steel like the earth's pulse. The tower sways—built to move, engineered for earthquakes, but water is different than shaking. Water is patient. Water finds ways.

"We're going to die here," she says, surprised by her own calm.

"No."

"How can you be sure?"

"Because I've calculated the scenarios. Water rise rate, building integrity, storm duration. We have until 4 AM before it reaches dangerous levels for this floor. Rescue will come by then."

"And if your calculations are wrong?"

He looks at her directly for the first time since the library. "Then at least I'm with someone who can see my paintings."

The bells above them start to ring—not musical, just wind and water making bronze sing its death song. Each note has a color in Chloe's vision: deep purple, infected green, the yellow of anxiety she knows so well but somehow isn't feeling.

"I should be panicking," she says.

"Why aren't you?"

"I don't know. Maybe because—" She stops, realizes she's about to be honest with a stranger who isn't a stranger. "Because this is real danger. Not the fake danger my brain usually creates. It's almost... relieving."

"I understand."

"Do you?"

He sits on the floor, back against the wall beneath his UV calculations. She notices his hands—stained with seventeen different blacks, but also colors she has no names for. Paint that won't wash off.

"I went to prison," he says quietly. "In Sweden. For something I didn't do."

She sits too, not close but not far. The floor is cold. Everything is cold except the space between them, which burns with something unnameable.

"What did they think you did?"

"Supported terrorism. Neo-Nazi connections. Because I bought a record—a vinyl record—from a band that turned out to be... more than a band. But I didn't know. I just wanted the music. I collect—collected—rare pressings. First editions. Things no one else has heard yet."

"Why?"

"Because I grew up poor. Everything I had was secondhand, pre-opened, already experienced by someone else. The first time I opened something new—really new, sealed, mine first—I was twenty-three. A record. The sound of the plastic wrap breaking was..." He closes his eyes. "It was what I imagine wealth feels like."

Chloe understands this in her bones. "I lie about going to college."

The confession comes out like water through a crack—sudden, unstoppable.

"I was supposed to transfer to UCSB. But COVID hit, and I spent senior year of high school in my bedroom, and something broke. When college started, I couldn't... I couldn't make myself go. So I pretended. For two years, I've pretended. My parents think I'm a student. I sit in parking lots and make up elaborate stories about professors and classes and friends that don't exist."

"Why?"

"Because the truth would kill them. They sacrificed everything for me to succeed. And I'm just... broken. I see too much, feel too much. The world is so bright it hurts."

"You see my paintings."

"I see everything. Too much of everything. Colors that don't have names. Patterns that shouldn't exist." She pulls out her pencils—why did she save these?—and arranges them on the floor. "This helps. Organizing by color. But the colors I see..."

"Show me."

She arranges them in what looks like a rainbow to normal eyes but is actually forty-seven distinct steps from red to violet, with seventeen more in between that shouldn't exist.

Hale stares. Then reaches into his pocket, pulls out a small vial of UV paint.

"What color is this?"

She looks. Sees twelve different shades swirling. "Blue-green-silver with edges of something like purple but not purple. Like... like the northern lights but underwater."

"Aurora borealis. You can see aurora borealis in paint."

"Is that what it's called?"

"It's what you are. You're aurora borealis. Impossible light made visible."

Lightning illuminates everything—the flooded campus, the drowned world, his face looking at her like she's a miracle instead of a malfunction.

"I painted for you," he says. "I didn't know it was you, but I painted for whoever could see what I was creating. And you answered. With your arrangements. We've been talking for months."

"What were we saying?"

"That we see the same world differently. That being invisible isn't the same as not existing. That sometimes the most beautiful things can only be perceived by broken people using broken light."

The water is at the sixth floor now. In the classroom below, they can hear crying, praying, someone trying to make phone calls that won't connect. But here, in this room, there's only the sound of bells and storm and truth.

"I should be with my parents," Chloe says. "They're in Montecito. Probably evacuating."

"Where would you rather be?"

She looks at him—really looks. Sees past the dyed-black hair to the natural color beneath (dark honey with silver starting at the temples). Sees past the maintenance uniform to the person who creates invisible beauty. Sees past the exhaustion to something else—recognition.

"Here," she admits. "I'd rather be here. With you. Even if we drown."

"We won't drown."

"How are you so sure?"

"Because this can't be how our conversation ends. We've only just started using words."

The tower sways again. Something crashes below—maybe windows, maybe walls, maybe the world ending. But in this room, surrounded by UV paintings that map disaster and transcendence, Chloe feels safer than she has in years.

"Tell me about the record," she says. "The one that ruined your life."

So he does. Tells her about Permafrost, about five copies pressed, about the arrest, the trial, the way he became a symbol of something he never was. Tells her about losing everything, coming to America, hiding in plain sight as a maintenance worker when he could have been a curator, a scholar, an artist.

"But then I wouldn't have painted the walls," he says. "Wouldn't have met you."

"We haven't really met. We don't even know each other's last names."

"Martinez," he says. "Chloe Martinez. You're registered for classes you don't attend. Your campus ID works in buildings you never enter. You're a ghost who doesn't know she's haunting."

"How do you—"

"I pay attention. Night shift means seeing what people leave behind. IDs, papers, pencils arranged in impossible patterns." He smiles—the first real smile she's seen. "Lindqvist. Hale Lindqvist. Swedish citizen, questionable legal status, owner of nothing except paint and the knowledge that someone, somewhere, could see what I was creating."

"And now?"

"Now we're trapped in a tower while the world drowns, finally having the conversation we've been having for months."

She moves closer. Not touching, but close enough to feel his warmth. He smells like rain and industrial cleaner and underneath, something else—hope, maybe. Or desperation. Or both.

"What happens when the water goes down?"

"I don't know."

"What happens if we survive?"

"When. When we survive."

"When we survive, then what?"

He turns to look at her. In the emergency light, his eyes are seventeen different blues, each one deep enough to drown in.

"Then we continue the conversation. With words this time. In daylight. Without water rising."

"What if we're only able to be honest because we think we're dying?"

"Then we'll have to find other reasons to tell the truth."

Below them, water rises. Above them, bells ring. Between them, years of messages painted and arranged, invisible to everyone else, obvious to each other.

The flood has trapped them, but they've been circling each other for months, creating art for an audience of one, waiting for disaster to make them visible to each other.

Now, with death possible and morning far away, they sit in their tower room, finally using words for what they've been saying all along:

*I see you.*
*You're not alone.*
*The invisible things are the most real.*
*We've been having this conversation forever.*
*We're just now learning the language.*
