# Voices in Color
*September 18, 2024 - Evening After Coffee Meeting*

---

Her apartment walls pulse with colors that don't exist.

Not hallucination. Not imagination. The coffee meeting—touching him, confirming seventeen warms, tasting their connection—amplified her tetrachromacy beyond previous limits.

Now she sees his frequency everywhere he's never been.

The phone sits on her kitchen table. His number glowing in screen-light that fractures into forty-three different blues. She's been staring at it for seventeen minutes.

Call him? Text? Wait?

Her hands arrange items unconsciously—salt shaker, pepper, sugar bowl—into pattern that mirrors her anxiety. The arrangement creates its own color: purple-gold-static that tastes like electricity before lightning.

The phone rings.

His number.

## The Voice: Auditory Privileged Perception

"Hale?"

"You see them now. The colors. In your apartment."

Not a question. He knows.


His voice through phone creates synesthetic cascade:
- Swedish accent = silver-blue frequency
- Exhaustion = purple underscore
- Hope = gold overtone
- Seventeen different emotional temperatures she can hear

"How do you know?"

"Because same happened to me. After tower. After touching you. Your frequency everywhere."

"My frequency?"

"Colors that shouldn't exist. Warmth without source. Like you leaked into universe and stained everything."


Her roommate Emma walks through, sees Chloe on phone.

"Hot date?" she mouths.

Chloe shakes her head. How to explain? That she's confirming quantum entanglement? That someone else sees impossible colors? That love might be visible in spectrum science hasn't discovered?

Emma shrugs, leaves.

## The Test: Proving Real Through Distance

"Describe what you're seeing," he says. "Right now. Your walls."

She looks. Really looks with all four cones firing.

"Northwest corner. Pearl-silver-violet spreading like slow lightning. Frequency about... 478 nanometers but shifted into UV. Tastes like mint and copper."

Silence. Then: "You're arranging something. While we talk."

She looks down. Her free hand has been organizing paper clips into spiral. Unconscious. Automatic.

"How did you—?"

"Because I'm painting. Same spiral. Right now. Without meaning to."


"We're still having the conversation."

"Twenty months of conversation. Even separated."

"Even now. On phone."

"Especially now."

## The Questions: Truth in Frequencies

"Tell me about the scars," she says. "The ones painted with UV."

Long pause. His breathing creates colors through the phone—inhale is blue-silver, exhale is gold-green.

"Month six. When searching failed. When I accepted you were gone. Needed to mark it. The losing. But also—"

"Also what?"

"Needed to create something only you could see. If you existed. If you ever found me. Evidence of waiting."

"Seventeen scars."

"You counted. At coffee."

"I count everything. Especially you."


His laugh looks golden through the phone. Not metaphor—literal synesthetic translation. Golden with edges of silver-sad.

"What number am I now?" he asks.

She's already calculating. Adding every temperature, every frequency, every impossible color he creates:

"Still infinite. But more infinite than this morning."

"Infinity can't increase."

"Ours can."

## The Memory Test: Confirming Tower Night

"Tell me something only we would know," she says. "From that night. Prove this is real."

"The kiss tasted like ending but looked like beginning."

"Anyone could guess that."

"No. You said specific words. After. When water stopped rising. You said: 'The kiss tastes like copper-mint-snow and looks like geometry that shouldn't exist.'"

Her breath catches. Those exact words. Her synesthetic description. No one else would remember that precisely.

"What else?"

"You counted. While we floated. Ninety-three. Over and over."

"Ninety-three what?"

"Different shades of black in darkness. You said darkness has colors too. That I looked like light that gave up being bright."


Every word correct. Every impossible description. He remembered her tetrachromatic perceptions perfectly.

"You really remember."

"Everything. Every color you described. Every pattern you saw. Every impossible thing you said. Memorized like prayer."

## The Plan: Making Visible Together

"Tomorrow," he says. "Library. Where we met yesterday."

"Why?"

"Want to show you something. All the paintings. From twenty months. Have them stored. Documented. Our entire unconscious conversation."

"Why show me?"

"Because—" His voice shifts, creates new color through phone. Color she's never seen before. Color that might be love if love existed in visible spectrum. "Because we can make something. Together. That no one else can make."

"Art?"

"More. Language. For colors without names. For connections that shouldn't exist. For love that paints itself in frequencies."


She sees it suddenly—not imagination but actual perception of probability:
- Gallery of impossible art
- Others with tetrachromacy finding them
- Language expanding to hold new colors
- Love becoming visible through art

"Ten AM?" she asks.

"Ten. And Chloe?"

"Yeah?"

"Wear something with color. Real color. Want to see how many you contain."

"How many do you think?"

"Infinite. But counting will be fun."

## After: The Colors Intensify

She hangs up. The apartment explodes with new frequencies. Not just his colors now—theirs. The combination creating something beyond either alone.

Emma returns. "You're glowing."

"What?"

"Not literally. But like... you look different. Happier?"


"Maybe."

"Who was that?"

"Someone who sees what I see."

"Another tetrachromat?"

Emma knows about the tetrachromacy. Partial truth. Safe version.

"No. He sees different impossibilities. But they match mine."

"That makes no sense."

"Nothing about us makes sense."

Emma studies her. "You arranged the entire spice rack while on the phone."

Chloe looks. Twenty-three spice jars in perfect gradient from white pepper to black cardamom. Arranged by frequencies Emma can't see. Pattern that probably matches something Hale painted tonight.

"It's how we talk," she says.

"Through spice arrangements?"

"Through everything. Colors. Patterns. Art. Frequencies that shouldn't exist."

"Sounds complicated."

"It's the simplest thing in the world."

And it is. Despite impossible colors. Despite twenty months apart. Despite speaking in spectrums.

Simple:
Two people seeing each other in dimensions others can't perceive.
Two people creating language for impossible things.
Two people proving love exists in frequencies science hasn't named.

Tomorrow they begin making it visible.

Tonight she arranges everything she owns by colors only she can see, knowing somewhere across town he's painting responses to arrangements he's never seen, continuing conversation that survived flood and separation and impossibility itself.

The phone lights up. Text from him:

"Your apartment walls still pulsing?"

"Yes. Stronger now."

"Good. Means it's real. All of it. Sleep in impossible colors."

She will. Surrounded by frequencies that prove connection transcends distance, that love leaks into universe and stains everything, that tomorrow they'll make invisible visible together.
