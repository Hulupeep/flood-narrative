# Chapter 5: Storke Tower
*September 2024*

The elevator is still broken.

A printed sign, laminated and re-laminated over twenty months, apologizes for the inconvenience. But Chloe knows it's not really broken—it's traumatized. The shaft flooded to the fourth floor that night. Even repaired, cleaned, certified safe, the elevator remembers drowning.

She takes the stairs.

Each step echoes differently than before—the flood changed the building's acoustics, left it hollow in new places, solid where water compressed things that shouldn't compress. She notices details others might miss: rust patterns like paintings where water reached, new paint that somehow looks wrong, too bright, too aggressive in its newness.

Third floor. Fourth. Fifth.

At each landing, she finds them—strange marks that shimmer when she tilts her head, fresh ones. Arrows. Words. Patterns. He's been here recently, maybe today, preparing something. Leading her somewhere.

Seventh floor. Eighth.

Her legs burn, but it's nothing compared to that night when they'd climbed these same stairs with water chasing them, when every step mattered, when Hale's hand had pulled her up and up and up until—

The carillon room.

The door is new, steel and glass replacing the old wooden one that had swollen and stuck as they'd forced it open. But the room beyond...

It's exactly the same.

The bells hang silent, massive bronze shapes that had rung constantly that night—not music but warning, automated emergency patterns that had made conversation almost impossible until the power died completely and they'd finally heard each other in the darkness.

She steps inside. The afternoon sun slants through windows that show the whole campus, the reconstructed lagoon, the ocean beyond. From up here, you can't see the trauma unless you know where to look—that grove of palms is new because the old ones drowned, that building's roof is different because it collapsed, that parking lot used to be a garden.

On the window, something strange. Fresh marks, still tacky when she touches them. Words in Swedish she doesn't need to translate because she feels them:

*I never left*

Below that, in English:

*Tuesday. 2 PM. Look up.*

She looks up.

The ceiling is covered in something—not random patterns but a map. Visible only when the light hits just right, like those hidden images she's always been able to see when others can't. The campus during the flood, water levels marked hour by hour, and throughout it, two dots moving, converging, separating, always aware of each other even when apart. Their story from that night, painted where only someone like her would think to look.

But there's more. Newer paint overlaying the old, showing the twenty months after. One dot stationary, moving in small patterns around campus. The other ranging wide—Santa Barbara, Solvang, Los Angeles, San Francisco—searching everywhere but here.

Her path. He'd been tracking her search for him while she looked everywhere except where he'd always been.

"You were here," she whispers to the empty room. "You were always here."

Something scrapes behind her. She spins.

A new message on the door she just came through, so fresh it's still wet, shimmering in that way she's learned means it's meant for her:

*Turn around*

She does.

Outside the window, on the construction crane working on the lagoon, someone has hung a banner. Not visible from ground level, only from this exact spot, this exact angle. It's covered in materials that catch light strangely—fabric, vinyl, things that shimmer with more complexity than they should. The blues and greens seem to shift and multiply when she looks at them, creating depths and variations that make her dizzy with recognition. The pattern matches her last pencil arrangement exactly.

He made this. For her. Visible only from where they'd been trapped together.

Her phone buzzes. Unknown number.

"Hello?"

Breathing. Then, his voice, unchanged: "You found them."

"Where are you?"

"Where I've always been. Invisible."

"I can see you. I've always been able to see you."

"Not me. My paint. There's a difference."

"Hale—"

"Tomorrow. 2 PM. This room. I need to show you something. Explain something."

"Explain now."

A pause. She can hear wind wherever he is, maybe on a roof, maybe in another high place watching her find his messages.

"I thought you died," he says finally. "In the evacuation. Different helicopters, different centers. I couldn't find you. Couldn't search because of my record, my status. They wouldn't tell me anything. For three months, I thought you'd drowned."

"I searched for you too."

"I know. I saw. You went to my uncle's bakery four times."

"You were watching?"

"I was hiding. I was—" His voice cracks. "I was afraid you'd remembered who I was. What I was accused of. That in daylight, without danger, you'd see me clearly and run."

"I've never seen anyone more clearly than I saw you that night."

Silence. Then: "The water's different now. Controlled. The lagoon has barriers, pumps, systems to prevent what happened. But I keep painting the escape routes. Just in case."

"For the next flood?"

"For you. So you could find your way back. Every UV painting is a breadcrumb, Chloe. I've been leaving you breadcrumbs for twenty months."

She presses her hand against the window, looking at his banner on the crane. "I'm here now."

"I know."

"So why tomorrow? Why not now?"

"Because there's something I need to show you. Something that only works at exactly 2 PM, when the light is right. Something about what we lost and what we found. And because—" He pauses. "Because I need one more day to be invisible. To prepare. To remember what it feels like to be seen."

"Hale—"

"Tomorrow, Chloe. Please."

The line goes dead.

She stands in the carillon room, surrounded by his UV paintings, his maps of disaster and survival, his twenty months of waiting. The bells hang silent above her, but she remembers their sound—bronze and terror and underneath it all, his voice saying "We're going to make it" while water rose and death felt certain.

Tomorrow. 2 PM.

Less than twenty-four hours to wait after twenty months of searching.

She looks at the ceiling map again, traces their paths with her finger—the moment they met in the library, the run to the tower, the climb to this room, the hours trapped together, the helicopter separation. And then her path spiraling outward, searching. And his, a tight orbit around campus, painting, waiting, believing she'd come back.

The sun is setting now, turning everything gold—but she sees more than gold. She sees the hundred shades of light that make gold possible, the invisible frequencies that create visible beauty.

Tomorrow she'll see him again.

But tonight, she has more breadcrumbs to follow, more UV messages to find, more pieces of the story he's been telling in paint only she can see.

She photographs everything—the ceiling map, the window messages, the banner on the crane. Her phone can't capture what her eyes see, but it's evidence she was here, she found them, she understood.

As she leaves the tower, taking the traumatized stairs down, she notices new marks on every landing—not words but colors, exact matches to shades she sees that others always insist aren't there. He's been studying how she sees, learning her visual language, painting in frequencies that don't have names except in her mind.

Outside, the campus prepares for evening. Normal students living normal lives, unaware they walk through a hidden gallery, a love letter painted in frequencies most will never perceive.

But she sees it all.

And tomorrow, finally, she'll see him.
