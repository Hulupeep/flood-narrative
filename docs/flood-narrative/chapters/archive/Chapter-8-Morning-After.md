# Chapter 8: Morning After
*September 2024*

Maria Santos is wiping down tables in the UCen when Chloe finds her. The same Maria from that night, who'd worked through the flood, who'd helped evacuate students, who'd seen everything and said nothing. She looks up as Chloe approaches, and her face breaks into something between smile and tears.

"Mija," she says, setting down her cloth. "You came back."

"You knew I would."

"I hoped. Hope and knowing are different things." Maria glances around, then leans closer, drops her voice. "He works days now. Has since February 2023. Never took a single day off, even when the campus was closed for repairs. The boy is painting his heart out on these walls."

"I know. I've seen them."

"Have you seen him?"

"Not yet. Tomorrow. 2 PM. The carillon room."

Maria nods slowly. "Twenty months is a long time to search for someone who never left."

"Why didn't he look for me? Really look?"

"Ay, child. Some people don't believe they deserve to be found. He thought you'd remember who he was—the arrest, the accusations—and run. Better to be a beautiful memory than a disappointing reality."

"He could never disappoint—"

"You don't know that. You knew him for one night. Under pressure. When dying makes everyone honest." Maria resumes wiping, but thoughtfully. "The boy who paints these walls isn't the same one you were trapped with. Twenty months changes people."

"I'm different too."

"Sí, I can see. Your colors are calmer. The anxiety yellow is almost gone."

Chloe freezes. "You can see—?"

"Not like you do. But I've been cleaning for thirty years, mija. You learn to see what others miss. The way you arranged things, so precise, so desperate. The way he painted in response. You two were dancing without music."

"What else do you know?"

Maria smiles. "I know he saved something from his storage unit before it flooded. One record, wrapped in plastic, sealed against water. He asked me to keep it safe. It's in my locker. Seven colors, he said. But you would see seventy."

The Botanist record. He'd saved it.

"Can I—"

"Tomorrow. After you see him. After you decide if twenty months of change is too much or just enough."

"What do you mean?"

Maria stops wiping, looks directly at her. "He's been painting your story on these walls. Not just the flood night—everything after. Your search for him in Santa Barbara, Solvang, Los Angeles. He knows you looked. He knows you grieved. He's been painting his grief too, but also something else."

"What?"

"Plans. For after you returned. Museums that need tetrachromatic eyes. Universities studying color perception. A life where your gift is gift, not curse. The boy's been building you a future in UV paint."

Chloe's eyes blur with tears—forty-three different shades of salt water, each carrying different emotions.

"Where is he now?"

"Marine Science Building. Replacing filters in the aquarium systems. The fish need clean water to survive. He says it's practice for keeping beautiful things alive."

Chloe stands to go, but Maria catches her hand.

"Wait. There's something else. Dr. Tanaka wants to see you. She has information about your condition. About others like you. You're not alone, mija. Not in any way."

"Others?"

"A whole study. Funded. Waiting for participants. She's been waiting for you specifically. Your friend Marcus told her about you."

The pieces falling into place. A future forming from flood wreckage.

"One more thing," Maria says, pulling a key from her pocket. "Storage unit 318. His new one. He wanted you to have this. In case."

"In case what?"

"In case you needed to understand who he really is. It's all there. His new collection, started from nothing. Every record bought with overtime pay. But also notebooks. Documenting your patterns, his paintings, the conversation you've been having. Two years of evidence that you've been connected all along."

Chloe takes the key. It's warm, like it's been held recently.

"Has he been watching me today? Following my path through campus?"

Maria's smile is answer enough.

Outside the UCen, Chloe looks for UV paint and finds it immediately—an arrow pointing toward Marine Science, fresh enough that she can smell the acrylic. She follows it, finds another, then another. He's painting her path in real-time, guiding her toward him even as he maintains distance.

The Marine Science Building rises ahead, rebuilt stronger, its glass walls reflecting the afternoon sun in ways that make her tetrachromatic eyes sing. Through the windows, she can see the aquarium tanks, blue-green water that holds a hundred colors.

She doesn't go in. Not yet. Tomorrow is for reunions. Today is for following breadcrumbs, reading his UV love letters, understanding how two people can be separated by evacuation and reunited by art.

Instead, she goes to storage unit 318.

Inside, perfectly organized: roughly two hundred records, each in protective sleeves. A fraction of his original collection but carefully chosen. On the wall, photographs of her color arrangements, dated and annotated. Notebooks filled with observations in handwriting that gets progressively more desperate as months passed without contact.

And in the corner, wrapped in plastic, sealed against all floods:

The Botanist record. Seven-color vinyl that sparked prismatic light in her enhanced vision. A sticky note on it in his handwriting: "For when you came back. Because I knew you would."

She sits on the floor of the storage unit, surrounded by evidence of obsession or love or both. Twenty months of him believing she'd return. Twenty months of her searching everywhere but here.

Tomorrow. 2 PM. The carillon room where they kissed while water rose.

She closes the unit, locks it, keeps the key.

On the walk back to her car, she finds more UV paint—not arrows now but words. Swedish mixed with English, fragments of songs they'd hummed in the darkness, coordinates of places they'd been separately but somehow together.

The last message, painted on the parking lot pillar where she'd started her day:

*See you tomorrow
Where the water stopped
When the light is right
For colors that don't have names
Except the ones we give them*

She photographs it, knowing her camera can't capture what she sees. Knowing that tomorrow she'll finally close the distance between searching and finding. Knowing that twenty months was both forever and nothing. Knowing that some conversations continue even when the speakers are separated by helicopters, evacuations, silence.

The sun sets over Santa Barbara, painting the sky in colors she's never seen before—or maybe she has, that night when the world ended and began, when she found someone who could see her invisible frequencies.

Tomorrow.

The word tastes like seventeen different hopes, forty-three different fears, and one perfect certainty:

He's been waiting.

She's been searching.

The water has receded.

It's time.
