# Chapter 8: Morning After / The Search Begins (Enhanced Causal Bridge)
*Present: September 2024 / Past: January-March 2023*

## Present - September 2024

Chloe wakes in her childhood bedroom, but she's not a child anymore. The UV paint pen is still in her hand, her fingers stained with invisible ink from trying to recreate the patterns she found yesterday. Her phone shows seventeen missed calls from her mother, three from Marcus, one from a number she doesn't recognize but desperately hopes is his.

She plays the voicemail from the unknown number:

"Is—" Static, breathing, Swedish accent barely audible. "Storage unit 247. Behind Milpas. I kept something. For you. If you're really back. If this is really you."

Her heart hammers. It's not Hale's voice, but someone who knows him. She checks the time—6 AM. Too early to go anywhere without raising suspicions, but she can't stay still.

She opens Instagram, scrolls to ColorSeeker93—her old account she thought she'd deleted. But it's there, restored somehow, and there's a new follower: InvisibleFrequencies805. The account has no posts, no profile picture, but it's been active—liking every single one of her color arrangements from the past twenty months, all timestamped within the last week.

He's been preparing for her return.

## Past - January 10, 2023 (Morning After the Flood)

Hale stands in the Goleta evacuation center, the Botanist record still clutched in his hand. Tommy is trying to get him to eat something, but food tastes like nothing. Everything tastes like nothing without her impossible colors describing it.

"Brother, you need to call someone," Tommy says. "Your uncle, anyone."

"My phone died in flood," Hale responds, but it's mechanical, automatic. His real voice is still trapped in Storke Tower, telling Chloe about Permafrost, about being invisible, about seeing her arrangements and knowing, somehow knowing, they were meant for him.

Maria Santos finds him there. She's managed to reach the evacuation center despite the flooding, and she holds something that makes him forget to breathe—Chloe's pencil case, salvaged from the library.

"She'll come back for these," Maria says simply. "And when she does, you better have something to show her. Something that proves this was real."

That's when Hale makes the decision that will consume the next twenty months: he's going to paint their story on every surface of campus, invisible to everyone except her.

## Present - Storage Unit 247

Chloe finds it behind Milpas, just as the message said. The door is already open, and inside—

Tommy Chen, sorting through boxes of vinyl records. He looks up, recognizes her immediately though they've never officially met.

"You're her. Color girl."

"You're his friend. From county."

"Brother," Tommy corrects. "He's my brother by choice. And he's been dying without you."

He hands her a box. Inside: photographs. Hundreds of them. Her color arrangements from before the flood, each one meticulously documented. And beside each photo, a matching UV painting under blacklight. The dates line up perfectly—she'd create an arrangement, and within hours, he'd paint a response.

"He was studying you," Tommy says. "Not in creepy way. In way of someone trying to understand language he could feel but not speak."

"Where is he now?"

"Working. Day shift. But Chloe—" Tommy pauses, pulls out another photo. This one's different. It's Hale in what looks like a therapy office, dated six months after the flood. He's thin, hollow-eyed, holding a UV light over a canvas covered in nothing but her name written in different colors, over and over. "He wasn't okay. For long time. Thought you died, then thought you forgot, then thought maybe he imagined whole thing."

## Past - March 2023 (Therapy)

Dr. Patricia Reeves doesn't usually take emergency cases, but something about the Swedish man in her office makes her reconsider. He's not speaking, just painting—UV paint that only shows under special light, creating elaborate patterns while tears stream down his face.

"Tell me about the patterns," she says gently.

"They're hers," he finally says. "Girl who sees impossible colors. We were trapped in flood. Eight hours. Whole conversation. Then helicopters came and—" He stops, adds more paint. "I search every evacuation center. Every hospital. Nothing."

"What do the patterns mean?"

"Is like... like she was asking questions with colors, and I was answering with paint. But neither of us knew we were talking. Until flood. Until emergency lights made everything visible."

Dr. Reeves watches him paint. Even she can see there's something profound happening in the invisible art—communication beyond words, connection beyond logic.

"You need to keep painting," she tells him. "Not to find her, but to stay yourself. Make the invisible visible, even if she never sees it."

That becomes his anchor. Paint the campus. Leave messages. Trust that somehow, someway, she'll come back.

## Present - The Pattern Emerges

Back in the storage unit, Chloe pieces together the timeline through Tommy's photos and stories. While she was searching every vinyl store in California, Hale was in therapy learning to live with invisible love. While she was posting color arrangements on Instagram as prayers, he was painting UV responses on every surface he could reach.

"There's more," Tommy says, leading her to the back of the unit. 

A massive canvas leans against the wall, covered in what looks like chaos but slowly resolves into pattern. It's a map of campus with dates, times, locations—every near-miss for twenty months. Every time they almost crossed paths, marked in UV paint that glows under Tommy's blacklight.

"March 15, 2023, State Street market, two aisles apart," Tommy reads. "July 4, 2024, harbor fireworks, seventeen feet separation. August 20, 2024, her first visit back to campus, his day off."

"He was tracking me?"

"You were orbiting each other. Like binary stars that don't know they're paired. Look—" He points to the center of the canvas. "September 8, 2024. That's today. Well, yesterday now. He painted this three weeks ago, when Maria called you."

The center shows Storke Tower, surrounded by spirals of UV paint that match exactly the arrangement she made with his paint pen last night in her room. He predicted her response before she made it.

"We're still synchronized," she breathes.

"You never stopped being synchronized. Distance just made it harder to see."

## Past - June 2023 (The Decision)

Hale sits in his new apartment—tiny, basically a closet, but his own space finally. The walls are covered in photos of Chloe's arrangements, printed from her Instagram before it disappeared. He's been sober from everything except paint for six months, and Dr. Reeves says he's making progress.

But progress toward what?

That's when he makes the choice: go back to UCSB. Take the day shift. Paint everything with UV messages. Create a beacon that only she can see.

"What if she never comes back?" Dr. Reeves asks in their session.

"Then I'll have made something beautiful that exists even if invisible," he replies. "Art doesn't need audience to be real."

But he's lying. The art needs her. He needs her. The conversation they started requires both voices to be complete.

## Present - The Revelation

"He knew you'd come back," Tommy says, showing her one final photo. It's dated last week—Hale standing in front of the rebuilt library, holding a UV light that illuminates a massive painting on the wall. It says, in letters two stories tall that only show in UV:

*She returns when the eucalyptus blooms again. Twenty months is nothing compared to invisible forever.*

"How did he know?"

"Maria called you three weeks ago, yeah? She told him same day. He's been painting eighteen hours a day since then, making sure every message was fresh, every trail was clear."

Chloe's phone buzzes. That unknown number again.

"Answer it," Tommy says. "Is time."

She does.

"Chloe?" Hale's voice, cracked with exhaustion and hope.

"I'm in your storage unit. With Tommy. I see everything. The map, the paintings, the documentation—"

"Is not about that." His Swedish accent thick with emotion. "Is about—I need to know. Was it real? In tower. What we felt. Was it real or just two people drowning who grabbed each other?"

She looks at the canvas map, twenty months of near-misses and parallel searching, two people circling each other without knowing, maintaining a conversation across impossible distance.

"It was real before the tower," she says. "We were already talking. The flood just made it visible."

Silence. Then: "You understand? The paintings before? You were responding?"

"And you were responding to my responses. We built something together without knowing we were building it."

"Så det är," he breathes in Swedish. "So it is."

"Where are you?"

"Tower. Always in tower at 2 PM. When light makes everything visible."

"It's 8 AM."

"Then I wait. Have waited twenty months. Can wait six hours more."

The line goes dead, but the connection remains. Chloe turns to Tommy, who's smiling.

"He's different now," Tommy warns. "Therapy changed him. Made him more visible but also more careful. He won't be exactly who you remember."

"Neither am I."

"Good. Ghost love is beautiful but real love needs real people."

She takes photos of everything—the map, the documentation, the proof that their connection survived separation and evolved through distance. Then she heads to campus, to the tower, to 2 PM when the light will make everything visible.

But first, she has six hours to follow his fresh UV trail, to read twenty months of invisible messages, to understand how two people can have a complete conversation in frequencies nobody else can see.

The morning after leads inevitably to the reunion.

The search ends where it began—in recognition that was always there, waiting for the right light to make it visible.
