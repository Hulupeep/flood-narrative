# Chapter 1: The Return (False Frame Version)
*September 2024*

The bathroom stall door has something written on it, and Chloe Martinez is the only one who can see it.

She shouldn't be able to—the door is freshly painted, pristine blue, part of UCSB's post-flood renovation. But the words shimmer against the surface like an oil slick, like a migraine aura, like something her brain is inventing because she's finally lost it completely.

*Don't disappear.*

The words aren't in English. She thinks they might be Swedish, but that makes no sense. Her hands start their nervous ritual—arranging paper towels by shade, creating patterns that soothe the crawling sensation behind her eyes. Seventeen different whites in industrial paper towels. Always seventeen lately, though she doesn't know why.

She takes a photo of the door with shaking hands. Through the camera screen, there's nothing. Just blue paint. But when she looks directly, the words pulse with their own light, written in something that makes her taste copper and snow.

*Great. The hallucinations are getting more specific.*

Outside the restroom, UC Santa Barbara thrums with September energy. The campus looks almost the same as before the flood—almost. New eucalyptus saplings where the old giants drowned, their bark too uniform, lacking something she can't name. Fresh concrete paths that hurt to look at, like they're vibrating at the wrong frequency.

Twenty months ago, she spent eight hours trapped in a flooding tower with a maintenance worker. Twenty months ago, she discovered things about herself that still don't make sense. Twenty months ago, rescue helicopters separated them, and she's been searching for him ever since.

Or maybe she imagined all of it. The therapist says trauma can create false memories, elaborate ones. Maybe there was no Swedish painter. Maybe she was alone in that tower, hallucinating connection while her brain misfired from fear.

"Chloe Martinez?"

She spins. Brad Hutchinson, her old counselor from SBCC. Still creepy, still looking at her chest before her face, but something's different. He seems... diminished.

"I kept copies of your transcripts," he says without preamble, shoving a folder at her. "From before the flood. Enough units to transfer. Barely."

"Why would you—"

"That boy you were trapped with. The maintenance worker. He's been asking about you."

The world tilts. So Hale is real. Unless Brad is part of the hallucination too.

"He's here?"

"Day shift now. Leaves things around campus. Weird stuff only certain people notice." Brad's eyes narrow. "You're one of those people, aren't you? Who sees things."

She doesn't answer, but her silence is confirmation enough.

"Thought so. There's something wrong with your eyes. Always has been."

*Wrong.* The word she's heard her whole life. Wrong for seeing too many colors. Wrong for arranging things obsessively. Wrong for noticing patterns that aren't there—except apparently they are there, just invisible to normal people.

Brad leaves, and Chloe notices something—a maintenance golf cart parked by the library. On its side, barely visible, a mark that could be dirt or could be something else. The number 2, drawn in something that catches light wrong.

She follows the cart's tire tracks, finding more marks. Arrows that might be her imagination. Numbers that disappear when she looks directly. Fragments of words in what could be Swedish or could be her brain creating patterns from nothing.

The marks lead to the library, third floor, the corner where she used to study. Where she still sometimes feels less alone, though she can't explain why.

The corner is different now—new furniture, fresh paint—but something's off. The wall shimmers when she's not looking directly at it. Like heat mirages, but it's September and the AC is blasting. She touches the wall, and her fingers come away with the faintest trace of something that glows under the fluorescent lights.

*Paint?*

Her phone buzzes. Unknown number.

"Hello?"

Breathing. Then a voice, accented, careful: "You can see them."

Not a question.

"I don't know what I see," she says truthfully. "I might be losing my mind."

"You're not. I promise you're not. Look up."

She does. In the library window, three floors up, a figure stands backlit. She can't see features, just a silhouette, but something about the posture, the way he holds his shoulders—

"Hale?"

"Don't disappear," he says, echoing the bathroom message she may or may not have imagined.

"I see things that aren't there," she blurts. "The therapist says it's stress. That the flood triggered something. That I'm—"

"You're not crazy. What you see is real. I can prove it."

"How?"

"Come to the tower. Where we were trapped. 2 PM tomorrow. When the light—" He pauses. "When the light is right, I'll show you everything."

The line goes dead.

Chloe stands in the library, surrounded by students living normal lives with normal eyes that see normal things. The marks on the walls pulse in her peripheral vision—messages or madness, she's not sure which.

Maybe she's having a psychotic break. Maybe the trauma finally caught up. Or maybe, impossibly, someone else knows what it's like to see things that shouldn't exist.

Tomorrow. 2 PM. The tower.

She'll either find answers or confirmation that she's truly lost it.

The shimmering on the walls seems to intensify, forming patterns that almost look like art, like someone's been painting invisible galleries where only broken people can see them. But that's crazy.

Isn't it?

## Present Timeline Misdirection Setup:

**The False Frame We're Building:**
- Chloe is traumatized and possibly hallucinating
- Her "visions" might be mental illness/PTSD
- The things she sees could be delusions
- Hale might not even be real (or might be differently troubled)

**What Readers Will Assume:**
- She has PTSD-induced hallucinations
- OR she has schizophrenia/psychosis
- OR she's seeing ghosts/supernatural elements
- OR this is magical realism

**The Hidden Truth:**
- She's tetrachromatic and seeing UV paint
- Hale has been painting for her eyes specifically
- Their connection is real and scientific
- Everything she sees actually exists

**Why This Works:**
- Creates suspense: Is she crazy or special?
- Makes the revelation more powerful
- Allows readers to doubt along with her
- The "wrongness" frame makes her gift more poignant when revealed
- Mental illness is a plausible red herring for unusual perception

This false frame will persist until Chapter 4 when the emergency lights reveal the UV paint and Hale names her condition, completely recontextualizing everything as real, scientific, and miraculous rather than pathological.
