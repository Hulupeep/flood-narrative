# Chapter 17: The Matchmaker's Secret
*Maria Santos - Multiple Timelines*

## September 2022 - Four Months Before the Flood

Maria Santos has been cleaning UCSB buildings for fifteen years, but she's never seen anything like this.

She discovered them by accident—stayed late to deep-clean the third-floor study room because her supervisor was coming tomorrow. When she turned off the overhead lights to check her work with a flashlight, the walls lit up with paintings.

Beautiful, invisible paintings that only showed under her UV inspection light.

At first, she thought it was vandalism. Some student making trouble. But the paintings were too beautiful, too careful, too... lonely. Messages in bottles that no one would ever find.

Then she recognized the style. The same precise lines she'd seen that Swedish boy making in his notebook during his breaks. Hale. The quiet one who worked nights, who barely spoke except to say thank you when she shared her tamales, who moved through campus like he was trying not to exist.

*Mijo,* she thought, *what are you doing?*

She started checking other buildings with her UV light. The paintings were everywhere—hidden galleries under stairs, in storage rooms, behind vending machines. Always in places where someone might accidentally discover them, but probably wouldn't. Love letters to no one. Maps to nowhere.

The boy was drowning in his own invisibility.

## October 2022 - Three Months Before the Flood

Maria noticed the girl because she was arranging pencils by the lagoon at 10 PM, when normal students were at parties or in bed.

Chloe Martinez. Maria knew her name from the student ID she'd found and returned last month. Pretty girl, but wound too tight, like a guitar string about to snap. Always alone, always arranging things in patterns that made Maria's eyes hurt if she looked too long.

The patterns were familiar, though. Where had she seen—

*Dios mío.*

The patterns matched Hale's UV paintings. Not exactly, but like two people humming the same song in different keys.

Maria started paying attention. The girl would arrange things—pencils, sugar packets, library books—and within days, Hale would paint UV responses in the same locations. He was following her, but not in a creepy way. More like... like he was trying to understand her language.

And the girl, without knowing it, was responding to paintings she couldn't consciously see. Her arrangements evolved based on his invisible art, creating a conversation neither of them knew they were having.

Maria had raised four children. She knew love when she saw it, even when it was speaking in frequencies no one else could hear.

## December 2022 - One Month Before the Flood

"Mijo," Maria said, finding Hale painting in the library basement at 3 AM. "You need to talk to her."

He froze, UV paint pen in hand. "Talk to who?"

"The girl who arranges colors. Chloe."

His face went pale, then red. "You know about—how do you—"

"I clean these buildings. I see everything. Including paintings that aren't supposed to be visible." She pulled out her UV flashlight, illuminated his latest work. "This one matches the pattern she made yesterday, no?"

He stared at her, then at the painting, then back at her. "She doesn't know I exist."

"She knows. Her body knows. Her eyes know. She just doesn't know she knows."

"That doesn't make sense."

Maria sighed, sat on a storage box. "My grandmother, she could smell rain three days before it came. Couldn't explain it, but her bones knew. That girl, she sees your paintings even when she can't see them. And you, you're painting her language without speaking it."

"I can't just—what would I say? 'Hi, I've been secretly painting UV art that matches your pencil arrangements'? She'd call security."

"Maybe. Or maybe she'd finally understand why she feels less alone in buildings where you've painted."

Hale's hands shook slightly. "You really think she—"

"I know she does. She lingers in rooms you've painted. Avoids ones you haven't. She's drawn to your frequency, mijo. But you're both too scared to make it visible."

"What if she sees me clearly and runs?"

"What if she sees you clearly and stays?"

He was quiet for a long moment, then returned to his painting. But Maria saw him add something new—tiny letters in the corner, barely visible even under UV: *For the girl who arranges colors.*

## January 8, 2023 - The Day Before the Flood

Maria was restocking bathroom supplies when she heard about the storm coming. Not just rain—real disaster. Atmospheric river, they called it. 

She found Hale first. "You need to go home."

"I have to finish something," he said, painting frantically in the stairwell.

"The storm—"

"I know. But if something happens, if we don't come back, I need her to know. I need to leave proof that someone saw her. Really saw her."

Then she found Chloe in the library, arranging pencils while the sky turned green.

"Mija, there's a storm coming."

"I'll leave soon," the girl said, but Maria knew she wouldn't. Both of them, so lost in their invisible conversation they couldn't see the visible danger approaching.

Maria made a decision. She called her supervisor, said she was staying to secure supplies. Really, she stayed to watch over two lonely children who didn't know they were in love.

When the power died and the emergency lights kicked in, she wasn't surprised to find them together in the third-floor study room, Chloe staring at suddenly visible UV paintings while Hale stared at her like she was a miracle.

"Go," she told them when the water started rising. "Tower. Highest ground."

She watched them run together, hands almost touching, and thought: *Sometimes it takes a disaster to make love visible.*

## January 10, 2023 - The Evacuation Center

Maria found them at Earl Warren, Chloe with her parents, Hale standing frozen twenty feet away, both terrified to cross that distance in daylight.

She walked straight to Hale. "What are you waiting for?"

"Her parents—they don't know who I am. What I am. The arrest, the accusations—"

"They know you saved their daughter."

"In the dark. In disaster. But in daylight—"

Maria grabbed his shoulders. "Mijo, you think love only counts if it happens in perfect conditions? You think connection is less real because it took a flood to make you visible to each other?"

"What if it was just—"

"Trauma? Fear? Adrenaline?" Maria laughed. "You were painting for her before the flood. She was responding before the flood. The flood just turned on the lights."

She pushed him gently toward Chloe. "Go. Be visible. It's scarier than drowning, but worth it."

## September 2024 - The Return

Maria had been waiting twenty months for this moment.

When she saw Chloe's rental car in Lot 32, she texted Hale immediately: *She's here.*

When he texted back *I can't*, she marched to his maintenance room.

"You painted this entire campus for her. You waited twenty months. She's HERE."

"What if she doesn't—"

"Hale Lindqvist, you listen to me. That girl searched all of California for you. She posted color arrangements online like prayers. She learned Swedish curse words. She almost broke into the vinyl store looking for you." Maria had been watching Chloe too, through Instagram, through her nephew who worked at the art store where she got a job. "She's here for YOU."

"How do you know?"

"Because I called her three weeks ago. Told her about the new paintings."

His face went white. "Maria—"

"Someone had to make you visible to each other again. The flood's over, mijo. Time to choose: stay invisible or be seen."

He was quiet for a long moment. Then: "The tower. 2 PM. When the light—"

"Makes the UV visible. I know." She smiled. "I'll make sure she finds the breadcrumbs."

## January 9, 2025 - The Exhibition

Maria stands in the Museum of Contemporary Art, surrounded by Chloe and Hale's work. The room is full of people discovering that invisible doesn't mean absent, that connection can happen in frequencies most people miss.

She finds them by the windows, holding hands, paint in their hair, completely visible to each other and everyone else.

"Maria," Chloe says, pulling her into a hug. "We never thanked you."

"For what?"

"For seeing us before we saw each other. For believing in a conversation we didn't know we were having."

Hale adds, "For pushing us toward each other when we were too scared to move."

Maria touches both their faces, these children she helped raise into visibility. "You were never invisible, mijos. You were just painting in frequencies that needed the right light. I just knew where the switch was."

She leaves them to their triumph, but keeps watching from across the room. Fifteen years of cleaning buildings, but her greatest work was recognizing love speaking in colors that don't have names, and making sure it found its voice.

Later, she finds the UV light in her pocket—the one she's carried since discovering Hale's first paintings. She clicks it on one last time, illuminating a message he's painted just for her on the museum wall, invisible to everyone else:

*Thank you for seeing us when we couldn't see ourselves. - H & C*

Maria Santos, matchmaker of invisible frequencies, keeper of secrets, cleaner of buildings and souls, smiles and puts the light away.

Her work is done.

The love is visible now.
