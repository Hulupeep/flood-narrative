# Chapter 15: The Exhibition Planning
*October 2024*

The Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara is closed to the public on Mondays, but Dr. Tanaka has connections. She's brought Chloe and Hale here to propose something ambitious—an exhibition of their work documenting tetrachromatic vision, scheduled for January 9, 2025. The second anniversary of the flood.

"Too soon?" Dr. Tanaka asks, watching them both carefully.

They stand in the main gallery, empty white walls waiting for art. Chloe can see the potential—their color samples arranged like a rainbow only she can fully perceive, Hale's paintings translating her vision, the UV pieces that survived the flood showing what connection looks like when it's invisible to most eyes.

"It's perfect," Hale says, but he's looking at Chloe, waiting for her agreement.

She walks the space, her tetrachromatic eyes catching things others miss—the seventeen different whites of the walls, each one reflecting light differently. The way the afternoon sun through the skylights creates colors that don't have names. Yet.

"We'll need more than the color documentation," she says. "People need to understand the story. Not just the science of tetrachromacy but... us. The flood. The searching. The finding."

"A narrative exhibition," Dr. Tanaka nods. "I was hoping you'd say that. The museum wants something that connects to the community's flood experience. Healing through art, visibility through disaster, that sort of thing."

Hale pulls out his notebook—not the scientific one for color formulas but his personal one, weathered and paint-stained. "I have sketches. From the twenty months we were apart. Every UV painting I made, documented. We could recreate them, show the progression of the conversation we didn't know we were having."

"And I have photos," Chloe adds. "Hundreds of them, trying to capture what I see. They never quite work—cameras can't process my spectrum—but the failure is part of the story. The impossibility of sharing vision directly."

Dr. Tanaka smiles. "The museum's offering the entire first floor. Three galleries. We could structure it chronologically—before, during, after."

"No," Chloe and Hale say simultaneously, then look at each other, surprised by their synchronization.

"Not chronological," Chloe continues. "Layered. Like the UV paint. Some stories only visible under certain conditions. We'll use different lighting in different rooms—normal, UV, emergency lighting like during the flood. Show how the same space contains multiple truths depending on how you see."

Hale is already sketching, his hand moving fast across paper. "The main gallery could be the present—our collaboration, the colors you see that I'm learning to paint. But underneath, UV paint showing the past. Visitors with UV flashlights could discover the hidden narrative."

"Like we discovered each other," Chloe adds.

"The second gallery could be the flood itself," Hale continues. "Dark, emergency lighting only. The paintings I made that night from memory, but also..."

"The separation," Chloe finishes. "Twenty months of searching. Your paintings of searching. My arrangements of longing. Apart but still in conversation."

"And the third gallery?" Dr. Tanaka asks.

They look at each other. Since their reunion six weeks ago, they've been carefully building—not just art but a life. Hale has a small apartment now, not hiding in the maintenance room. Chloe is officially enrolled at UCSB, actually attending classes about perception and art. They work together every afternoon, translating her impossible vision into shareable form.

"The future," Hale says quietly. "What we're building. Not just documenting tetrachromacy but creating a new visual language. Showing that different ways of seeing aren't disorders but gifts."

"And the connections," Chloe adds. "We've been getting emails. Other tetrachromats who heard about the research. People who see differently—synesthetes, people on the spectrum who process visually. We're not alone in seeing invisible things."

Dr. Tanaka pulls out her tablet, starts making notes. "The museum wants an opening event. January 9th, evening. They're calling it 'Invisible Frequencies'—if you're comfortable with that title."

Chloe reaches for Hale's hand. Seventeen warms, always, but also something new these past weeks—steadiness, presence, the feeling of being held without drowning.

"That's what we are," she says. "Invisible frequencies finally made visible."

"There's one more thing," Dr. Tanaka says. "The museum wants to commission a permanent installation. Something for the sculpture garden that commemorates the flood but also... transcends it. They're offering significant funding."

Hale and Chloe exchange glances. They've been discussing this privately—the possibility of creating something lasting, something that proves their connection wasn't just trauma but transformation.

"We have an idea," Hale says. "A viewing station. Multiple panels of treated glass, each one filtering different light spectrums. When you look through them at the same view, you see different versions of reality. Some will approximate what Chloe sees. Others will show UV spectrum. Others will fragment light in ways we haven't imagined yet."

"Showing that everyone's vision is limited," Chloe adds. "That what we call reality is just one frequency among many. That invisible doesn't mean absent."

"It would be expensive," Hale warns. "The glass treatment alone—"

"The museum has flood memorial funds," Dr. Tanaka interrupts. "And there's a grant from the National Science Foundation for public art that demonstrates scientific principles. This qualifies."

They spend the next two hours walking the galleries, planning. Chloe describes the colors she sees in each space, Hale sketches installation ideas, Dr. Tanaka coordinates with the museum staff who've appeared, drawn by the energy of creation.

By late afternoon, they have a plan. Ninety-three pieces total—one for each shade of blue-green Chloe saw in the flood water. The exhibition will tell three stories: the science of tetrachromacy, the art of translation, and the love story of two people who found each other through invisible paint.

"We'll need to work nonstop," Hale says as they stand in what will be the main gallery. "Three months to create enough pieces, document everything, build the installation."

"Together," Chloe says. It's not a question anymore.

"Together."

Dr. Tanaka leaves them to lock up, trusting them with the space. As the afternoon light fades, Hale pulls out a small bottle of UV paint from his pocket.

"What are you doing?"

"Marking the space. So in January, when the gallery is full of people and art and noise, we can find this moment with UV light. The moment we decided to make our invisible visible."

He paints small letters on the baseboard, invisible unless you know to look: *C & H, October 2024, no longer drowning.*

Chloe watches the paint dry, sees it shift through seventeen stages of transparency before becoming truly invisible. But she knows it's there. Will always know.

"Hey," she says.

"What?"

"We're going to tell our story. Publicly. The real story."

"Scared?"

"Terrified. You?"

"Same." He caps the paint, stands, takes her hand. "But we survived a flood. We survived twenty months apart. We survived finding each other again. We can survive being seen."

They leave the museum as the sun sets, painting Santa Barbara in the gold-pink that Chloe sees as two hundred different colors. The ocean is calm, no sign of the monster it became that January night. The mountains are clear, not dropping torrents of rain.

"January 9th," she says. "People will come expecting a story about disaster."

"And we'll give them one. But also a story about what remains after everything washes away. About the conversations we have without knowing we're having them. About the art that's always there, waiting for the right light to make it visible."

"About love?" She's never used the word before, not even during their most intimate moments these past weeks.

He stops walking, turns to face her. In this light, his eyes are all seventeen blues at once, plus colors she's only now learning to see—the gold of possibility, the green of growth, the silver of tears that come from joy not grief.

"About love," he confirms. "The kind that starts invisible and slowly, carefully, becomes something everyone can see."

Three months to create an exhibition. Three months to translate her impossible vision into shareable art. Three months to tell the story of things lost in the flood that weren't things at all.

They walk home—his apartment tonight, hers tomorrow, slowly building a rhythm that isn't desperate but deliberate. Behind them, the museum holds their invisible mark, their promise to make beauty from disaster, art from isolation, love from recognition.

January 9th, 2025. The second anniversary of the night they found each other while the world drowned.

This time, they'll be ready.

This time, everyone will see.
