# Chapter 3: The Library
*September 2024*

The automatic doors of Davidson Library whoosh open too eagerly, as if the building itself is desperate for students, for life, for normalcy. The smell hits Chloe immediately—new carpet, industrial adhesive, the particular emptiness of spaces rebuilt after trauma. Every fiber is wrong, screaming synthetic newness where old wool should whisper decades of student anxiety and coffee spills.

She stands in the entrance, unable to move. Twenty months ago, water had pushed through these same doors—different doors then, wooden ones that had swollen and burst from the pressure. She'd watched from the third floor as the lagoon invaded, claiming the first floor like it had always belonged to the water.

"Can I help you?" 

A student worker, probably sophomore, bright-eyed in a way that means she wasn't here for the flood. Chloe shakes her head, forces her feet forward. The new carpet is aggressively blue—UCSB's colors but somehow wrong, too uniform, too cheerful. It makes her dizzy in a way she can't explain, like it's vibrating at a frequency that hurts.

The stairs are the same. Thank god, the stairs are the same. Her hand finds the railing, worn smooth by thousands of hands before the flood, thousands after. Metal doesn't forget the way carpet does. Metal remembers.

Third floor, northwest corner. Her spot. Their spot, though they'd never known it.

The corner is different—new study carrels, pristine white surfaces that haven't learned how to hold desperation yet. But the window is the same, looking out over the lagoon that isn't there. Construction equipment moves in lazy patterns where water should be, yellow machines she can barely stand to perceive.

She sits, places her hands flat on the new desk, and breathes.

That's when she sees it.

In the corner where wall meets window, protected by the architectural overhang, a small section of old paint remains. The flood hadn't reached this high, and renovation had somehow missed this six-inch square of original wall. And on it, something strange—marks that seem to shimmer when she tilts her head, like those Magic Eye puzzles that reveal hidden images if you look just right—

Words. In Swedish. In invisible paint.

*För henne som ser*

She doesn't speak Swedish, but she's googled enough of his language these past twenty months. *For her who sees.*

Her eyes adjust, something shifting in her perception. There's more. Newer. Whatever this is, it's different—fresher, applied recently. Maybe yesterday. Maybe an hour ago.

*Jag är fortfarande här*

She photographs it with her phone, knowing the camera won't capture what she sees. Later, Google Translate will tell her what she already feels in her bones: *I am still here.*

Below, barely visible even to her enhanced vision, a number: 3361.

She knows that number. It's burned into her memory like her own name. It's the call number for a book—*The Science of Color Perception* by Dr. Yuki Tanaka. The book she'd been pretending to read that last normal day, the book that had been floating past the second-story window when—

No. Stay present. Stay now.

Chloe rises, moves through the stacks with purpose now. The new carpet whispers different songs than the old, but the shelving system is the same. 3361. Third floor, eastern stacks, technical sciences.

The book is there. Pristine replacement copy, spine uncracked. But protruding from the top, barely noticeable unless you're really looking, a slip of paper.

She pulls it out. It's not paper—it's vinyl. A piece of vinyl record, carefully cut, painted with UV paint on one side. The message is in English this time:

*Tuesday. 2 PM. Where the water stopped rising.*

The carillon room. Where they'd been trapped. Where they'd kissed thinking death was certain. Where the water had stopped just inches from the floor they'd claimed as their last stand.

Tuesday is tomorrow.

Her hands shake as she holds the vinyl fragment. The grooves catch the light strangely, creating patterns that shouldn't be there—depth and variation where others might see uniform black. She lifts it to the light and gasps.

There's something on the reverse. Marks that seem to shift and change as she tilts it, forming a pattern she recognizes—it matches exactly the last arrangement she'd made with her pencils on the bench, the last normal moment before everything changed.

He'd been watching then. He remembers.

He's been watching now.

She turns, scanning the library with new eyes. He could be here. Maintenance works days now, Brad had said. He could be one floor below, fixing something. He could be—

"Chloe?"

She spins. Marcus stands there, her old friend, AzureSkies94, looking older but somehow lighter.

"Marcus? You're still here?"

"PhD program. Studying with Dr. Tanaka actually. She's been waiting for you to come back."

"Waiting?"

"She has something to show you. About... the way you see things. She says you're not the only one who sees the world differently. She says—" He pauses, looks around, lowers his voice. "She says he's been painting the whole campus. New paintings. Different from before. Hidden in plain sight. They're... they're love letters, Chloe. Every single one is a love letter to someone who can see them."

The vinyl fragment burns in her hand. Tuesday. Tomorrow. 2 PM.

"Where is he now?" she asks.

Marcus shakes his head. "I don't know. Nobody sees him. He's like—"

"A ghost."

"No. Ghosts are dead. He's more like... invisible frequency. You can't see him, but he's everywhere, affecting everything. Leaving traces only certain people can detect."

Through the window, she catches movement. A maintenance cart passing below. The driver is too far to see clearly, but something about the posture, the way he holds his shoulders—

She runs. Down three flights, through the aggressive blue carpet, past the too-eager automatic doors. But the cart is gone. Only tire tracks in construction dust, and in that dust, barely visible, a pattern drawn by the wheels.

The same pattern as her last pencil arrangement.

He's not just here. He's been orchestrating everything. Waiting for her to come back. Leaving messages only she can see.

Tomorrow. 2 PM. Where the water stopped rising.

She'll be there.

But first, she has twenty-four hours to follow his hidden trail, to find these strange messages scattered across campus, to understand what he's been trying to tell her all these months while she searched for him everywhere but here.

The hunt begins now.
