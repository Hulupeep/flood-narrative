# Seventeen Warms
*September 18, 2024 - The Next Day*

---

The coffee shop on State Street smells wrong.

Not bad—just wrong. Like they've tried to recreate what existed before the flood but the proportions shifted. Too much vanilla. Not enough dust. The kind of wrong only someone with synesthetic tetrachromacy would notice—vanilla reads as amber-white but this amber has blue edges, disaster-tinged, like everything since.

Chloe arrives seventeen minutes early.

Parks herself at the corner table where she can see both entrances, the window, the back exit she mapped within seconds of arrival. Habits from twenty months of searching—always watching for a tall Swedish silhouette that never appeared.

Until yesterday.

Her phone shows 2:43. They agreed on 3:00. Neutral time. Neutral location. Professional meeting to "discuss the research project" as she told Maria, who didn't believe a word but had the grace not to push.

The barista—nose ring, flood survivor tattoo on her wrist—brings water without being asked.

"You okay? You look—"

"Fine."

But she's not. Her hands arrange the sugar packets by their color frequencies—white has twelve variants if you count the UV spectrum bleeding through the window. Sweet'N Low pink screams at wavelength that tastes like artificial strawberries. The brown sugars sing bass notes only she can hear.

Pattern. Control. Order in chaos. Same coping mechanism since childhood, but more urgent now because—

The door opens.

Not him. Just someone tall, male, wrong proportions. Her synesthesia dismisses them instantly—no seventeen-warm signature, no UV shimmer in peripheral vision, no pull in her chest like gravity sideways.

2:47.

## The Approach: Privileged Perception

She sees him before he enters.

Not him—his reflection. In the window across the street, distorted by afternoon sun hitting at thirty-seven degrees, the same angle that makes UV visible. He's standing outside. Has been for—she counts his micro-movements—at least three minutes.

He's nervous.

His heat signature through glass reads as purple-gold anxiety, the color of someone trying to decide whether to run.

Then he turns, and their eyes meet through two panes of glass, across twenty feet of space, and her tetrachromacy explodes into recognition—

Seventeen. Always seventeen. Seventeen different blues in his eyes even from this distance. Seventeen degrees of warmth radiating from his body. Seventeen micro-expressions crossing his face in the span of one breath.

He enters.

## The Test: Double-Encoded Scene Begins

[SURFACE: Professional meeting about research]
[UNDERNEATH: Are you real? Was it real? Is this real?]

"Hi."

"Hi."

They stare. The coffee shop continues around them—espresso machine hissing, students typing, world spinning—but they're frozen in assessment.

The coffee shop walls display local art. One piece has a small gallery sticker in the corner: 'Holbrook Contemporary.' Hale's jaw tightens when he sees it. His heat signature spikes—anger-orange bleeding into the seventeen warms.

"You know that gallery?" she asks.

"Later," he says. Not avoiding. Promising.

He's thinner. Shadows under eyes darker—not just tired but UV-painted, she realizes. He's been painting himself. Marking his skin in frequencies only she can see. 

"You painted your exhaustion."

"You arranged your anxiety." He nods at the sugar packets, now in perfect spectrum formation.

"It's louder here. The colors. Than yesterday in the library."

"Because more people?"

"Because you're closer."

BECAUSE proximity amplifies her synesthesia
THEREFORE his presence makes everything louder
BUT she can't explain why
THEREFORE just accepts it

He sits. Across from her, not beside. Professional distance. Safe distance. Testing distance.

"So," he says. "Research project."

"Right. Research."

"On parallel creation during trauma separation."

"And unconscious communication through invisible art."

"Very professional."

"Completely."

They're failing at surface conversation. Every word operates on both tracks, and they both know it.

"Coffee?" she asks.

"I don't—not anymore. Since flood."

"Why?"

"Tastes like afterwards. Like red cross stations and questioning and searching for—" He stops. "Tea. I drink tea now."

"What kind?"

"Whatever doesn't taste like drowning."

## Recognition: The Seventeen Warms

The barista approaches. He orders chamomile. She orders nothing—her mouth already tastes copper from anxiety, doesn't need caffeine amplifying the frequency.

When he reaches for his wallet, his sleeve pulls back.

Scars.

Not from flood. These are precise. Geometric. Painted over with UV ink that makes them into art—seventeen parallel lines that her tetrachromatic eyes read as sheet music, as topographical map, as confession.

"You marked yourself."

"You see them."

"When?"

"Month six. When I thought—when searching failed. When I accepted you were gone."

"But kept painting."

"Painting differently. On myself. Where no one could see."

"I would see."

"You weren't there to see."

"I'm here now."

The words hang. Present tense. Declarative. Both surface and underneath.

His tea arrives. He wraps his hands around it—seventeen different temperature zones that make her mouth flood with the taste of recognition. Those hands. Those specific hands that painted impossible frequencies. That touched her in the tower. That she's drawn from memory a thousand times without getting the proportions right because memory lies but tetrachromacy doesn't.

"Can I—"

She reaches across the table. Stops. Waits.

He nods.

Her fingers touch his hand.

## The Touch: Synesthetic Explosion

[PRIVILEGED PERCEPTION - All senses firing]

Seventeen warms, but more:

- **Temperature**: Each finger different—index finger 98.7°F, middle 97.9°F, thumb 99.1°F because closer to pulse point
- **Texture**: Calluses from painting map like braille under her fingers—she can read his art history in ridges
- **Vibration**: His pulse through skin, 73 beats per minute, accelerating to 77 when she traces his knuckles
- **Visual**: Where they touch, colors bloom that don't exist—UV-gold-silver spreading like ink in water
- **Auditory**: The contact makes sound in her head—cello strings but electronic, ancient but impossible
- **Gustatory**: His skin tastes like copper-mint-snow through her fingers (synesthesia doesn't follow logic)
- **Olfactory**: Smells Swedish pine and California salt, oil paint and UV chemicals, hope and fear in equal measure
- **Temporal**: The touch lasts three seconds and three years, no difference

"It's you," she says. Stupid. Obvious. But needed.

"How do you know?"

"Seventeen. You're always seventeen. Different temperatures but always seventeen. It's how I knew in the tower. How I know now."

"That's impossible. Body temperature doesn't—"

"Nothing about us follows rules."

## The Test Intensifies: Failed Witnesses

A couple at the next table glances over. The woman whispers something. The man shrugs.

They see: Two flood survivors having coffee.

They don't see: The UV paint under his skin. The colors exploding where they touch. The shimmer in the air between them. The way sugar packets arranged in spectrum create harmony only tetrachromatic eyes can perceive.

"They think we're on date," he says.

"Aren't we?"

"Is this date?"

"I don't know what this is."

"Research meeting."

"Right."

"Where we test hypothesis."

"What hypothesis?"

"That connection forged in extremity persists beyond crisis."

She pulls her hand back. The absence aches in colors—gray-blue-empty.

"You've been reading about trauma bonds."

"Haven't you?"

BECAUSE both fear false connection
THEREFORE research trauma bonds
BUT this feels different
THEREFORE need new language

"What did you find?" she asks.

"That they fade. Always. Once danger passes, neurochemicals normalize, connection dissolves."

"It's been twenty months."

"Exactly."

"And you still painted. I still arranged."

"Exactly."

"So either we're broken—"

"Or this is real."

## The Challenge: Free Indirect Merge

Coffee shop too loud. Colors screaming. Every surface has seventeen variations minimum and her brain catalogs them all, compulsive, exhausting, necessary.

He's watching her count.

"How many?" he asks.

Knows her already. Twenty months apart but knows she's counting, always counting, can't not count.

"Four hundred ninety-three distinct colors in this room. Not including you."

"Why not including?"

"Can't count you. Every time I look, you're more. Different angle, different frequencies. Like counting while universe expands."

"Is that poetic?"

"It's literal. You exist in more dimensions than I can process simultaneously."

Old couple enters. Woman has tetrachromacy—Chloe can tell by how her eyes track UV light bleeding through window. But lesser version. Sees maybe fifty million colors where Chloe sees hundred million.

The woman looks at their table. Stops. Stares.

"Oh," she says to her husband. "Look at them."

"What?"

"Can't you see it? The light between them?"

"What light?"

"Never mind."

She winks at Chloe. Knows. Sees something. Not everything—not the UV paint, not the seventeen warms, not the full spectrum—but something.

[FAILED WITNESS TEST - Partial validation]

"Someone else sees," Chloe whispers.

"Sees what?"

"Us. Something about us. Light between us."

"What kind of light?"

"The kind that means this is real."

---

## The Decision

"I want to show you something," he says.

Pulls out phone. Opens photos. Paintings. Hundreds. All from the last twenty months.

All of her.

Not portraits—abstracts. But unmistakably her. The way she arranges colors. The patterns she creates. Her specific frequency interpreted through his eyes.

"You painted me. Without seeing me."

"From memory. Every day."

"Why?"

"Because—" He stops. Restarts. "In Swedish we have word. *Saknad*. Means missing but more. Like—phantom limb. Part of you gone but still feeling it."

"I know the feeling."

"Do you?"

She pulls out her own phone. Shows him photos. Twenty months of arrangements. Pencils, leaves, books, stones—all in patterns that mirror his paintings. Unconscious response to art she never saw.

"We were having conversation," she says. "Even separated."

"Through what medium? How?"

"I don't know. Maybe trauma creates quantum entanglement. Maybe tetrachromacy lets me perceive connections others can't. Maybe we're delusional."

"All three?"

"Probably."

## The Test Result

He stands. She panics—leaving already? Failed test? Too much?

But he comes around table. Sits beside her. Close enough she can map his heat signature without trying. Seventeen warms radiating like personal aurora.

"Yesterday," he says, "in library. When we recognized each other. What did you feel?"

"Like drowning but reverse. Like surfacing after twenty months underwater."

"Same."

"That's trauma response. Shared metaphor. Doesn't prove—"

He kisses her.

Not like the tower kiss—that tasted like ending.

This tastes like beginning. Like coffee shop normalcy and afternoon light and no water rising and time to learn each other without death circling.

She sees colors behind closed eyes—not the explosive frequencies of crisis but softer spectrum. Sustainable colors. Daily colors. Colors that could last.

When they part, the coffee shop hasn't stopped. No one stares. World continues.

But everything's different.

"Still think trauma bond?" he asks.

"No."

"What then?"

She looks at him. Really looks with all four cones firing, perceiving spectrums that shouldn't exist. He's not beautiful in conventional frequencies. But in the ones she can see—the UV paint under skin, the seventeen warms of his specific heat, the shimmer of his presence—he's everything.

"I think we're something that doesn't have a name yet."

"So we make one. Like colors."

"What would we call it?"

He thinks. "In Swedish: *Ödesbunden*. Bound by fate. But more—"

"Bound by frequency."

"*Frekvenskärlek*."

"Frequency love?"

"Love in spectrums others can't perceive."

The old woman with partial tetrachromacy walks past their table. Pauses.

"Forty years," she says. "Been seeing light between people forty years. Never seen it this bright."

She leaves before they can respond.

[WITNESS VALIDATION - Partial but real]

"So," Chloe says. "Research project?"

"Research project. Document everything. Prove connection beyond trauma. Create art only we can make."

"Together?"

"Is there another way?"

She kisses him again. In the coffee shop on State Street that smells wrong but feels right, surrounded by witnesses who can't see what they are, creating colors that don't exist except between them.

The reunion test: Passed.

The connection: Real.

The future: Invisible but there, waiting to be painted in frequencies only they can perceive.
