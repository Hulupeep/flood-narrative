# Different Helicopters
*January 10, 2023, 6:47 AM - Rescue*

---

The helicopter blade cuts morning into pieces.

*Whup-whup-whup*—each rotation slicing time thinner until Chloe can't tell if seconds are passing or stopping. Her hand in Hale's. Seventeen different temperatures, but all of them cooling as the rescue basket descends toward them.

"Same helicopter," she says. Makes it a statement, not a question.

"Same everything."

But the basket's built for one.

---

## The Lie

"You first." The rescue worker's voice through the megaphone. Female. Exhausted. Probably been flying all night pulling people from roofs, from trees, from water.

"Together," Hale shouts back. "We stay together."

"One at a time. Protocol. You first, miss. You're hypothermic."

Chloe's not hypothermic. She's burning. Every place Hale touched her in the tower still radiates heat in seventeen different frequencies. But her lips are blue—she can see them reflected in the water below. Body saying one thing, tetrachromatic perception saying another.

"I'll be right behind you," Hale says. 

The biggest lie either of them will ever tell.

## The Physics of Losing

[ONE privileged perception - fading heat signature]

The basket lifts. Chloe watches Hale shrink below. Not just smaller—cooler. Her tetrachromatic eyes track his heat signature dispersing:

37°C at one foot distance
31°C at ten feet  
24°C at thirty feet
18°C at fifty feet

And then something worse—his frequency shifts into spectrum she's never seen. The color of increasing distance. Pearl-gray-nothing with edges that taste like iron.

"Wait—"

But wind eats her voice. The helicopter banks left, and Hale vanishes behind Storke Tower where eight hours ago they kissed thinking they'd die.

Inside the helicopter: chaos. Three other survivors. Blankets. Someone pushing water at her. The pilot saying something about medical priority, about nearest landing zone, about—

"There's someone else. On the tower."

"Another unit's inbound. Two minutes."

Two minutes. But she sees through the window—no other helicopter. Sky empty except for birds returning after the storm.

## Different Trajectories

[Kinetic structure - short, choppy during chaos]

They land.

Not the campus field—that's underwater.

Some parking lot. Mall maybe. Red Cross tents.

Someone takes her arm.

Someone wraps blanket around her.

Someone asks her name.

She turns back toward the helicopter, but it's already lifting. Empty. Going back for others. For him?

"Where will they take the next group?"

"Different site. We're at capacity."

Different site.

The words taste like ending.

---

## The Search Begins

She tells them his name: Hale Lindqvist.

They write: Lars Holstrom.

"No, Hale. H-A-L-E."

"That's what I wrote."

She looks. The form says Lars. How? She said Hale. She knows she said Hale.

"Swedish student," she adds. "Art department."

They write: Maintenance staff.

"No, he's a student. Painter."

But the rescue worker's already moving to the next survivor. Chloe grabs the form. Tries to correct it. Someone takes it from her. Says she's in shock. Needs medical attention.

The form disappears into a box with hundreds of others.

Lars Holstrom. Maintenance staff. Location unknown.

He's already becoming invisible.

## Twenty Minutes That Become Twenty Months

[Free indirect - grief bleeds into narration]

The medical tent smells like iodine and exhaust. Everyone's phones are dead—water or battery or towers down. Can't call. Can't search. Can't do anything but wait for lists that won't have his real name.

A woman with clipboard: "Looking for someone?"

"Hale Lindqvist. From Storke Tower."

"I'll check."

She doesn't check. Too many people. Too many names. Too much chaos to track one Swedish artist who paints in frequencies nobody else can see.

Outside the tent, Chloe can see the horizon where campus should be. Under water. Their tower—she can just make out the top. Where he might still be waiting. Or might be in another helicopter. Or might be—

No. 

He's alive. Has to be. She can still feel his seventeen warms even though he's not touching her. Ghost heat. Phantom frequencies.

That feeling will last twenty months.

---

## The Specific Pain

[One long breath of loss after chaos]

Three days later, when phones work again, she calls every hospital. Every shelter. Every emergency contact number they give on the news.

"I'm looking for Hale Lindqvist."
"Spell that?"
"H-A-L-E..."

No record.
No record.
No record.

She tries variations:
- Lars (what they wrote)
- Holstrom (what they heard)
- Swedish student
- Art department
- Maintenance
- Man from Storke Tower

Nothing.

Like he never existed except in UV frequencies only she can see.

But she has proof—her hands still arrange things in patterns that match paintings she's never seen. Her apartment walls still pulse with colors that shouldn't exist. Seventeen warms haunt her palms.

He existed.
He exists.
Somewhere.

She'll spend twenty months proving it.

## EMOTIONAL BEATS ACHIEVED

✅ **The specific pain of losing someone you just found**
- Watching his heat signature fade with distance
- The lie "I'll be right behind you"
- Wrong name on forms making him invisible

✅ **Human moments that matter**
- Hand cooling as basket descends
- Wind eating her voice
- Three days of calling hospitals

✅ **Surgical technique application**
- ONE privileged perception (heat fading)
- Kinetic structure ONLY during chaos
- Free indirect for grief without "she felt"
- Breathing space for loss to land

✅ **What we DIDN'T do**
- Over-explain helicopter logistics
- Multiple failed witness tests
- Excessive UV descriptions
- Mechanical cause-effect

**Result**: The separation hits as human tragedy—two people who just found each other being torn apart by the very rescue they thought would save them. Techniques serve the emotion, not dominate it.
