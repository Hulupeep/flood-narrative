# Following Invisible Trails
*September 18, 2024 - Present Day, Morning Before Coffee Meeting*

---

The library basement hums at frequency 432.7 Hz.

No one else hears it. Chloe knows because she's watched seventeen people walk past without reacting. But to her tetrachromatic synesthesia, the sound has color—pearl-violet with edges that taste like copper pennies.

The hum intensifies near the wall where yesterday she found Hale.

Where twenty months ago water reached.

Where now fresh UV paint blazes in frequencies that shouldn't exist.

She photographs it with her phone. Through the screen: blank wall. Through her eyes: a map.

She searches "UV art Santa Barbara" to understand. A news article from last year catches her eye—'Gallery Owner's Son Cleared in Vandalism Case.' James Holbrook. The name means nothing to her. Yet. But there's something about the case—accusations of stealing another artist's work, UV techniques mentioned. She screenshots it without knowing why.

## The UV Trail


The paint creates a path. Not obvious—nothing about this is obvious. But her fourth cone processes UV wavelengths into patterns:

Arrow pointing toward humanities building →
Spiral near the emergency exit ↺
Numbers that aren't numbers but coordinates ⟐
Swedish words becoming English becoming something else ⟆

"Examining the water damage?"

Dr. Reeves from facilities. Clipboard. Concerned expression. Can't see anything she's seeing.

"The walls. They're—"

She almost says "covered in messages"

"They're what?" He looks where she's pointing.

"Still showing moisture variance."

"We've tested thoroughly. No moisture detected."

He leaves. The hum continues. Her phone vibrates—Maria.

"Find anything?"

"A trail."

"What kind of trail?"

How to explain? That someone has been painting navigation in invisible light? That the paintings respond to her presence—intensifying when she's close, fading when she backs away?

"I'll show you when I know where it leads."

## The Humanities Building: Third Floor

The trail leads here. Through maintenance corridors. Up stairs nobody uses. To a door marked "Storage" that blazes with UV text:

*För dig som ser*
(For you who sees)

Her hand trembles on the doorknob. Not fear. Recognition. The paint is still wet in UV spectrum—he was here recently. Maybe minutes ago.

Inside: 

Not storage. Art studio. Hidden gallery. Every surface covered in paintings that exist in frequencies between visible and invisible.

But more—

The paintings are responses. To her Instagram posts. To her pencil arrangements. To patterns she's created over twenty months thinking she was alone.


October 2023: She arranged leaves by campus fountain
→ He painted the same gradient in UV

December 2023: She sorted books by color frequency
→ He recreated the pattern on the east wall

February 2024: She had anxiety attack, arranged sugar packets
→ He painted her panic in colors that scream

Every arrangement she's made has an answer here.

"Oh my god."

Not her voice. She spins—

Marcus stands in doorway. Board shorts despite September. But his eyes are wrong. Glazed.

"Can you see—?" she starts.

"See what? Empty room. Told facilities about it weeks ago. Kids were using it to smoke."


She looks again. The room blazes with art. Marcus sees nothing.

"You okay, Martinez? You look—"

"Fine. Just thought I saw... mice."

"Gross. I'm out."

He leaves. She's alone with twenty months of invisible conversation.

## The Heat Map


She can see where he's been. Body heat lingers in UV spectrum—different temperatures for different times:

Hot (37.2°C): He was here in last hour
Warm (31.5°C): This morning
Cool (24.8°C): Yesterday
Cold (18.3°C): Days ago

The hottest spot is by the north wall. Fresh painting. Still liquid in frequencies only she can process.

It's her.

Not a portrait—abstract. But unmistakably her arrangement from yesterday. The pencils she lined up while waiting. Transformed into art that exists in impossible space between real and unreal.

Underneath, in that careful Swedish-English fusion:

*Kaffe klockan tre?*
*Coffee at three?*

The coffee meeting. He's confirming. But more—he's been here, watching her discover his trail, painting her discovery in real-time.

"I know you're here," she says to the empty room.

No response. But the heat signature shifts. Gets warmer near the door. Recent passage.

She follows.

## The Chase: Peripheral Pursuit


Can't see him directly. But in peripheral vision where her fourth cone is strongest—movement. Tall figure. Always just around corners.

Down stairs.
Through hallways.
Past students who don't notice someone moving in frequencies they can't perceive.

The shimmer trail leads outside. Across the quad. Toward—

The coffee shop.

He's leading her to their meeting. But early. Why?

---

## The Coffee Shop: Hidden Layer

2:17 PM. Forty-three minutes before their meeting.

The shop looks normal. Smells wrong (flood-changed). But in UV spectrum—

Messages. Everywhere. Painted in frequencies only she can see:

On the bathroom mirror: *Twenty months of searching*
Under her usual table: *Seventeen warms remembered*
On the window: *You see me / Jag ser dig*

He's been preparing. Setting the stage. Creating context only she can perceive.

"Bathroom's for customers only."

Barista with nose ring. Flood survivor tattoo. Doesn't see the blazing messages.

"I'm meeting someone."

"At three. I know. Tall guy? Accent? He's been here since noon. Painting or something. Weird dude."


"Painting?"

"Yeah, but like, invisible painting? Moving his hands but nothing there. We almost called someone but he bought tea every hour so..." Shrug.

Invisible painting. For three hours. Creating a gallery only she can see.

## The Revelation: Understanding the Trail

She sits at the corner table. Surveys his invisible work. Understands suddenly—

This isn't just for their meeting.

It's evidence.

Proof they've been communicating unconsciously. Every UV message documents a response to her patterns. Dated. Timed. Creating undeniable record of parallel creation.

Her phone buzzes. Unknown number. Text:

"Look up."

She does.

He's on the roof of building across the street. Visible for exactly three seconds. Holds up something—UV light. Makes every invisible painting in the coffee shop blaze simultaneously.

Then gone.

But the message is clear: *I've been here all along. Painting for your impossible eyes. Waiting for you to see.*

2:43 PM.

Seventeen minutes until their official meeting.

Seventeen. Always seventeen.

The trail wasn't random. He led her through their entire unconscious conversation. Showed her the evidence. Prepared her for what's about to happen:

Reunion that's actually recognition.
Coffee that's actually confirmation.
Research that's actually love making itself visible.


She sees it all at once—past/present/future collapsed into single moment:
- Every UV painting he's made
- Every pattern she's arranged
- Every response creating response creating response
- Twenty months of unconscious faith
- This moment when invisible becomes visible

She understands: The trail wasn't just to the coffee shop.

It was through their entire connection.

And it leads to him.
