# The Shimmer at Thirty-Seven Degrees
*January 9, 2023, 2:00 PM - Before the Storm*

---

The lagoon shimmers wrong.

Not the surface—that's just wind-rippled water catching afternoon sun. Underneath. In frequencies that make Chloe's teeth ache, like biting aluminum foil but translated to vision.

She sits on the bench where she always sits. Arranging her colored pencils in gradients only she can map. Forty-seven distinct shades from white to black, but really three hundred and twelve if you count the UV spectrum bleeding through at this angle.

"Hey Martinez!"

Marcus from her discussion section. Board shorts and flip-flops despite January cold.

"Storm party tonight at Sigma. You coming?"

The shimmer intensifies behind him. Like heat waves but in spectrum that tastes purple. She's been seeing it for weeks—always in the same places. Library basement. Third floor of humanities. The lagoon path. Following a pattern she can't decode.

"Can you see—" She stops.

Points at the shimmer.

Marcus turns, squints.

"See what?"

"Nothing. Just thought I saw..."

"You're weird, Martinez. But like, good weird."

He leaves. The shimmer remains. Pulsing now, synchronized with something she can't identify.

## The Pattern Recognition

BECAUSE she sees patterns others miss
THEREFORE notices connections
BUT can't share them
THEREFORE processes alone

Her pencils form a spectrum that mirrors the shimmer's frequency. Not consciously. Her hands move without permission, creating arrangements that respond to things she doesn't understand.

"Extraordinary gradient."

The voice comes from behind. Accented. Careful consonants like English is a second language worn carefully.

She doesn't turn. In her peripheral vision—where her fourth cone catches maximum input—she sees him. Tall. Pale. Pushing a maintenance cart but moving like a dancer, like the cart is camouflage.

"Just pencils," she says.

"Not just. Is answering something."

Her hands still. He sees the pattern? But when she turns to look directly, he's already moving away, cart wheels squeaking, just another invisible service worker.

Except—

UV paint on his hands. Seventeen different shades including frequencies that shouldn't be visible in daylight. But the angle—that thirty-seven-degree angle—makes them blaze.

## The Storm Approaches: Thermal Perception

3:47 PM. The air changes.

Not temperature—pressure. But Chloe's synesthesia translates it to color: green-gold building at the edges of everything, like the world is developing a fever.

Emma finds her by the library steps. "You coming to the basement thing? Safe space for storm anxiety?"

The basement. Where the shimmer is strongest. Where something waits in UV frequencies.

"Maybe."

"Chloe." Emma sits beside her, close enough that her body heat registers as orange-pink concern. "I know you see things differently. My cousin has synesthesia too. It's okay."


"It's not synesthesia."

"Then what?"

How to explain? That she sees hundred million colors where others see three million? That UV light speaks to her in frequencies that taste like electricity? That someone has been painting invisible messages only she can perceive?

"Just different."

Emma's phone buzzes. "Shit. They're upgrading to mandatory evacuation for coast. You staying on campus?"

"Yeah."

"Alone?"

"Always."

## Following Invisible Trails

5:23 PM. The library basement.

She shouldn't be here. Should be in her dorm, preparing for the storm. But the shimmer pulled—not metaphorically but literally, like magnetism in her chest.

The wall that looked blank yesterday blazes with UV paint.

Fresh. Still wet in spectrums others can't see. Words in Swedish she doesn't understand but somehow feels: *Ser du mig?*

Do you see me?

Her hand rises to touch the paint. It's warm—seventeen different temperatures in swirling patterns, like someone painted with their body heat.

"Beautiful, yes?"

She spins. The maintenance worker. Closer now. His eyes are green but really forty-three different greens if she maps the spectrum, and in the forty-third green she sees something that looks like recognition.

"You painted this."

Not a question. She knows. The seventeen warms match his heat signature exactly.

"Is test," he says. "To see if anyone notices."

"I notice."

"Yes. You do. Every time."


"Every time?"

"October. November. December. You respond to paintings you shouldn't see. Arrange things to match frequencies that don't exist for normal eyes."

"How do you—"

"Because I paint them. And you answer. We've been having conversation for months."

The shimmer isn't random. It's him. His trail through campus. UV paint marking his path in frequencies only she can perceive.

"Who are you?"

"Hale. And you're the girl who sees impossible colors."

## The Last Normal Moment

6:00 PM. They stand in the basement surrounded by his invisible gallery.

"Storm coming," he says. "You should evacuate."

"You're not evacuating."

"No. Have work to finish."

"Painting?"

"Something else. Something that needs completing before—" He stops. In UV light from her phone flashlight, his face shifts through spectrums of reluctance.

"Before what?"

"Before they realize what I know."

She should ask what he means. Should probe the cryptic statement. But the storm pressure makes everything taste green-gold-urgent, and his presence creates seventeen different warmths in the air between them, and she's tired of pretending she doesn't see impossible things.

"Show me," she says. "Whatever you're painting. Show me all of it."

He studies her. She wonders what he sees—girl who arranges pencils obsessively? Girl who stares at blank walls? Girl who counts colors that don't have names?

"Power will fail," he says finally. "When storm hits. Emergency lighting is UV-based in some buildings. Will make everything visible."

"Everything?"

"Everything I've painted. Everything hidden. Everything that's been waiting for someone who can see."

Thunder rolls. Not close yet but coming.

"Where should I go? When the power fails?"

"Tower," he says. "Carillon Tower. Highest point. If flooding comes, go there."

"Will you be there?"

He's already walking away, cart squeaking. But his answer carries in frequencies only she can hear—painted on the walls in UV:

*Yes.*
