# Frequencies Only She Can See
*November 21, 2024 - Two Months After First Contact*

---

## Part 1: The Bathroom Discovery

The message shouldn't exist.

UV paint invisible to normal eyes blazes across the bathroom stall door in letters that taste like copper-salt-snow. Swedish. Fresh. Still tacky when Chloe touches it with her fingertip.

*Hitta mig där vattnet började.*

Find me where the water began.

Two months of conscious communication through painted messages and arranged responses, and still he surprises her. This isn't their usual pattern—his UV paintings in maintenance areas, her Instagram arrangements responding. This is direct. Immediate. Almost desperate.

Something's changed.

"You okay in there?" 

Emma from orientation. Pottery major. Standing right outside, probably worried about the girl who's been in the bathroom stall for ten minutes making sounds like she's either crying or having a revelation.

Both, actually.

"Fine." Chloe's hand hovers over the latch.

"You sure? You've been in there a while."

"Period stuff," Chloe lies. Universal excuse. Conversation ender.

"Oh. Do you need—?"

"I'm good."

She could open the door. Point. Say *look at the door. Tell me what you see.*

Her hand drops.

BECAUSE Emma won't see it.
THEREFORE Chloe stays silent.
BUT the message pulses like it's alive.

The toilet in the next stall flushes. Footsteps approach the sinks. Safe now to emerge. Chloe opens the door, walks to the mirror, doesn't look at Emma washing clay from her fingernails—gray clay that's actually seventeen different grays if you count the ultraviolet spectrum bleeding through, but who's counting?

She is. Always counting colors that don't have names.

Footsteps retreat to the next stall. Lock clicking. Safe now to study the message without looking insane.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Swedish. She's learned enough Swedish phrases in the past two months to recognize the urgency in these words. The crowns over the a's—å's technically. The way the words flow like water themselves.

Find me where the water began.

But more than the words—the taste. Copper-salt-snow. His taste. She's learned to distinguish his thermal signature, his paint chemistry, even his emotional state through frequencies only she can access. This message tastes like fear.

Like goodbye.

"Oh my god," Emma says from the next stall. "Did you see Marcus's post about the lagoon thing?"

"What?" Chloe forces herself to respond. Normal. Be normal.

"The commemoration. For the flood anniversary. Well, not anniversary—that's January. But like, for fall semester people who weren't here then?"

The toilet flushes. Footsteps to sink. Chloe counts to five, opens her stall door, walks to the mirrors. Doesn't look at Emma washing clay from her fingernails—gray clay that's actually seventeen different grays if you count the ultraviolet spectrum bleeding through each particle.

"He wants everyone there by four," Emma continues, working soap through her fingers. "Some kind of healing circle thing. Very Marcus."

Marcus. Philosophy major. Thinks trauma can be "processed" through "community witnessing." Wasn't here during the flood. Doesn't understand that some things can't be witnessed because they exist in frequencies others can't see.

"I have a thing," Chloe says.

"Come on. I know you were here during—" Emma stops. Recalculates. Her reflection shows the careful expression people get when they remember Chloe is Category Five Trauma—trapped in tower, nearly drowned, lost someone.

"Sorry. I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine."

"It's just, Marcus says communal healing—"

"I really do have a thing."

Emma rinses her hands. The water runs clear but Chloe sees the mineral content—twelve different compounds, each with its own spectral signature. Santa Barbara water. Different from before the flood. Everything's different after.

"Is it about him?" Emma asks suddenly.

"What?"

"The guy. The one you've been seeing. Maria told me you finally found him."

Maria. Of course. Trying to help by explaining why Chloe's been happier lately, less obsessive, more grounded. Why she's stopped arranging pencils in desperate spirals and started creating patterns that look like joy.

"It's complicated," Chloe says.

"Love during unusual circumstances always is."

Love. The word hangs between them like UV paint—invisible to Emma, screaming to Chloe.

Emma dries her hands. "If you change your mind about the lagoon—"

"I won't."

"But if you do—"

"Emma." Chloe turns from the mirror. "I can't. The lagoon is where—where the water—"

"Where it began. I know. Maria told me that too."

Where it began. The same words from the UV message. Coincidence? Or is Emma seeing something she doesn't realize she's seeing?

"You keep looking at the stall door," Emma says.

Chloe freezes.

"Is there something—?"

"Graffiti. Someone wrote something gross."

"Ugh. People are disgusting." Emma doesn't look. Doesn't verify. Just accepts. "I'll report it to maintenance."

"No!" Too sharp. Chloe softens. "I mean, I already did. They're coming tomorrow."

"Cool." Emma heads for the door. Pauses. "Chloe? I don't know what's happening with you and the Swedish maintenance guy, but whatever it is, I hope it works out. You seem... lighter lately. Like you're finally where you belong."

Emma leaves. The bathroom empties. The afternoon light shifts—3:49 PM. One minute left of visibility.

Chloe returns to the stall. Studies the message. Takes a photo, though she knows the UV won't show up on her phone's camera. Only her eyes can capture this frequency.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

The water began at the library. Ground floor. Where she first saw his UV paintings two months ago, where their conscious relationship began, where everything changed.

But the taste of the message suggests something else. Something urgent. Something ending.

3:50 PM. The light shifts. The message disappears.

But the taste of copper-salt-snow remains.

Stronger now. With an edge of finality.

## Part 2: The Library Emergency

**[Earlier that morning - 11:30 AM - Campus Coffee Shop]**

Maria slides into the seat across from Chloe with unusual urgency. No coffee this time. Just concern.

"We need to talk."

Chloe looks up from her arrangement of sugar packets—seventeen in a spiral that's become automatic over two months of conscious communication with Hale.

"About?"

"About your Swedish boy."

"His name is Hale."

"I know his name. I also know he's in trouble."

Chloe's hand stills on the packets. "What kind of trouble?"

"The James Holbrook kind."

The name hits like ice water. James Holbrook—the student who accused Hale of stealing his artistic style, sexual harassment, academic fraud. The accusations that were later proven false but nearly destroyed Hale's life anyway.

"That was resolved. Holbrook admitted he lied."

"Publicly, yes. Privately, he's been building a new case. Something about vandalism. Property damage. Unauthorized use of university facilities."

"The paintings?"

"The paintings. Someone's been documenting them. Photographing locations. Measuring chemical composition. Building evidence."

"But they're invisible to most people—"

"Not if you know where to look. Not if you have UV photography equipment. Not if you have someone feeding you information about locations."

Chloe's synesthesia translates the conversation into colors that taste like nausea. Gold-green anxiety. Purple fear. Silver-gray desperation.

"How do you know all this?"

"Because James Holbrook is dating my cousin. And my cousin talks too much when she drinks. And she drinks a lot lately because dating James Holbrook is like dating a walking lawsuit."

"What's his plan?"

"Wait until Hale's in a compromising position. Document everything. Present it as evidence of systematic vandalism by university employee. Get him fired. Probably arrested."

"When?"

"Soon. This week, maybe today. Rachel says James has been obsessed, convinced that if he can destroy your Swedish boy, it'll somehow restore his reputation."

Chloe stands abruptly, scattering sugar packets.

"Where are you going?"

"To warn him."

"Chloe—"

"He can't get caught painting. Not today. Not when we're so close to—"

"Close to what?"

She doesn't answer. Can't explain that they're approaching breakthrough. That two months of conscious collaboration has been building toward something. That tonight, when the UV paintings align with her arrangements in perfect sequence, they'll create something unprecedented.

Art that bridges impossible perception.
Connection that transcends individual consciousness.
Proof that love operates on frequencies beyond physics.

"Just—if you see him, warn him. Tell him to stay away from campus today."

"I don't see him. You're the only one who sees him."

"You've seen him. At the coffee shop. Maintenance uniform, paint under his nails—"

"I've seen a tall blonde guy who might be Swedish. Could be anyone."

But it's not anyone. It's Hale. And if James Holbrook has been watching, documenting, building a case—

Her phone buzzes. Text from unknown number:

*"Sista dagen. Allt måste vara klart." - Last day. Everything must be finished.*

Another text immediately after:

*"If they stop me, find the tower paintings. Remember everything we've created."*

Her blood turns to ice.

"Maria, I have to go."

"Chloe—"

"Now. If I don't find him first—"

"What? What happens?"

"We lose everything."

## Part 3: The Chase

**[12:15 PM - Davidson Library Basement]**

The UV paintings are disappearing.

Not naturally. Someone's covering them. White paint applied in harsh, efficient strokes that eliminate years of invisible art in minutes. Industrial bleach that destroys chemical bonds at molecular level.

Chloe runs through the basement, watching their conversation vanish under institutional cover-up. Three floors of messages—his paintings, her photographic responses, their evolution from unconscious to conscious communication—being erased by maintenance workers who have no idea what they're destroying.

"Wait!" she calls to one of them. "You can't—"

"Orders from administration," the worker says. "Unauthorized paint on university property. Has to go."

"But it's not visible—"

"If it's not visible, then no harm removing it."

Perfect circular logic. If only she could see it, then only she would mourn its destruction.

She takes photos frantically, though her phone camera can't capture UV frequencies. Documentation for herself. Proof that this beauty existed.

Her phone buzzes. Another text:

*"Third floor. Humanities. They haven't reached it yet."*

She runs.

---

## Part 4: The Discovery

**[12:30 PM - Third Floor Humanities Building]**

She finds James Holbrook directing the destruction.

Not personally wielding brushes—too sophisticated for that. But clearly orchestrating. Pointing to specific locations. Cross-referencing with photographs on his tablet. Methodically eliminating evidence of invisible art.

"That wall there. And behind the water fountain. Get every trace."

He sees her watching. Smiles with satisfied malice.

"Miss Martinez, isn't it? The girl who sees things that aren't there?"

"They are there. You know they are there. That's why you're destroying them."

"I'm preventing vandalism. Protecting university property from unauthorized alteration."

"It's art."

"It's criminal damage. And your friend the Swedish janitor is about to discover that actions have consequences."

"Where is he?"

"Probably wondering why campus security is looking for him. Or why his supervisor received anonymous tips about unauthorized after-hours access. Or why his work visa might be under review for violations of terms."

The words hit like physical blows. Visa review. Deportation. Loss of everything he's built here.

"You can't—"

"I can. I am. Some people think they can hide their crimes behind invisibility. But eventually, someone with proper equipment finds them. Documents them. Brings them to light."

He shows her his tablet. UV photographs of Hale's paintings. Locations. Timestamps. Chemical analysis proving unauthorized substances applied to university property.

"Three years of systematic vandalism. Hundreds of violations. More than enough for criminal charges."

"But why? He never hurt you. Never stole anything from you."

"He stole credibility. Made me look like a liar when I was telling the truth about his methods. Do you know what it's like to be publicly humiliated? To have everyone think you're delusional?"

"Yes," Chloe says quietly. "I do know."

"Then you understand why I can't let this go."

"I understand why you think you can't. But James—look at what he's created. Look at the beauty."

"I can't see beauty in wavelengths that don't exist for normal people."

"Then you can't see him at all."

She leaves James directing his destruction and runs toward the tower.

---

## Part 5: The Tower Reunion

**[1:00 PM - Storke Tower]**

The stairwell blazes with urgency.

Not his usual careful messages but desperate communication. Words painted over words. Layers of UV that pulse with emotion even her enhanced perception can barely process.

*Måste gå* - Must go
*De kommer* - They're coming  
*Hitta mig* - Find me
*Älskar dig* - Love you

The last phrase stops her cold. Love you. In Swedish, painted in frequencies only she can see, layered over months of careful communication that's been building toward this admission.

He loves her.

She loves him.

And they're about to lose each other to bureaucratic persecution.

Fifth floor. The carillon room. Their usual meeting place where impossible conversations become conscious creation.

The door stands open.

Inside: Hale, painting frantically. Not creating art but recording it. Photographing his own work with UV-capable camera. Documenting three years of invisible messages before they're destroyed.

"You got my message."

"About the water? About where it began?"

"About running out of time." He doesn't stop working. "James Holbrook has won. Campus security is looking for me. Immigration has questions. Tonight I become invisible permanently."

"No."

"Chloe—"

"No. We don't run. We don't hide. We make this visible."

"To whom? Who else can see what we create?"

"Everyone. If we do it right."

She moves to the wall where his most complex painting waits—months of layered UV creating portrait she's never seen complete. Mathematical patterns. Swedish words. Frequencies that translate her existence into colors.

"What's this?"

"You. As I see you. In spectrums that don't exist for anyone else."

The painting is impossible beautiful. Not realistic but essential. Every frequency he associates with her presence rendered in pigments that glow with their own meaning.

"And this?" She points to blank space beside it.

"Waiting for you to complete it. The final collaboration. What we create together when we're both fully conscious of what we are."

Footsteps on the stairs. Multiple sets. Heavy boots. Campus security responding to anonymous tips about unauthorized access.

"Time's up," Hale says.

"Then we finish this now."

She grabs a brush. UV paint that tastes like completion. Together they face the blank wall.

"What do we paint?"

"Truth. What we are. What we've been creating without knowing. What becomes visible when impossible connections refuse to stay hidden."

They paint with urgency, with love, with twenty-two months of communication distilled into pure creation. Not separately—together. His movements completing hers. Her patterns illuminating his.

The wall fills with frequencies that don't have names.

"There!" A voice from the stairwell. "Fifth floor!"

Footsteps climbing. Time measured in seconds.

"Chloe."

"Yes?"

"Whatever happens, remember this. Remember us. Remember what we proved."

"That invisible doesn't mean alone."

"That connection transcends everything. Physics. Logic. Fear."

"That some frequencies exist only between specific people."

"And those frequencies are worth protecting."

The door bursts open. Three security guards. James Holbrook behind them, documenting with his tablet.

"There. The vandal. And his accomplice."

But they've finished. The wall glows with completed collaboration. Portrait of connection rendered in colors that scream their reality to anyone who knows how to look.

"What vandalism?" asks the lead guard. "I don't see anything."

James raises his tablet. Shows the UV photographs.

"Use a blacklight. Check the wavelengths. You'll see unauthorized paint covering every surface."

"We don't carry blacklights."

"Then bring one!"

"Sir, if we can't see damage with normal vision, we can't cite anyone for it."

Chloe understands. Policy protecting university from frivolous complaints. If vandalism isn't visible to naked eye, it doesn't qualify as property damage.

But James isn't finished.

"He's here after hours without authorization. Check his schedule. Check his access logs."

The guards look at Hale. Tall, pale, paint under his fingernails. Maintenance uniform giving him access others wouldn't have.

"You're supposed to be here?"

"Maintenance emergency. Report of UV light fixtures malfunctioning. Need to test spectrum output."

It's plausible. Technical enough to sound legitimate.

"Any work orders?"

"Electronic system. Filed this morning."

The guards exchange looks. This is above their authority level.

"We'll need to verify with your supervisor."

"Of course."

"Don't leave campus until this is resolved."

They start to go. James follows, arguing about proper investigation, about bringing UV detection equipment, about not letting criminals escape through bureaucratic loopholes.

Alone again.

"That was close," Chloe says.

"That was temporary. He won't stop. Won't let this go."

"Then we have to make it impossible to stop."

"How?"

She looks at their completed painting. Two people rendered in impossible frequencies. Connection that transcends individual perception. Art that proves love operates beyond physics.

"We make it public. Show everyone what we've created."

"They can't see it."

"Then we teach them to see it."

An idea forming. Impossible but necessary.

"The exhibition."

"What exhibition?"

"Maria's been planning student art show for December. Showcasing unusual work. I could submit this. Frame it as study in expanded perception."

"But they can't see it."

"Not without help. But what if we provided help? UV lights. Explanation of tetrachromacy. Scientific context for impossible colors?"

"Make the invisible visible?"

"Make the invisible understood."

He considers. Hope fighting skepticism.

"It could work. Or it could expose us completely. Make us targets for more than James Holbrook."

"Everything worth doing involves risk."

"And if they see us as freaks? Medical curiosities? Lab experiments?"

"Then we'll be visible freaks instead of invisible normal people."

"I'd rather be invisible with you than visible without you."

"Then we stay visible together."

They kiss surrounded by paintings only they can see. Twenty-two months of unconscious communication finally resolved into conscious choice.

They're going public.
Making invisible visible.
Teaching world to see beyond three-cone vision.
Proving that love operates on frequencies beyond normal perception.

Revolution starting with art.
Evolution beginning with connection.
Everything changing because two people refused to believe impossible means alone.

The tower fills with light.
The conversation becomes visible.
Everything changes.
Everything begins.

## Part 6: The Plan

**[3:30 PM - Maria's Apartment]**

"You want to do WHAT?"

Maria stares at them across her coffee table. Hale sits quietly, letting Chloe explain. Two months of conscious collaboration has taught them to present unified front.

"An exhibition. UV art made visible through proper lighting. Scientific explanation of tetrachromacy. Public demonstration of expanded perception."

"That's—ambitious."

"That's necessary."

"Chloe, honey, I support your artistic vision, but this sounds like coming-out party for mutant superpowers."

"Tetrachromacy isn't mutation. It's evolution."

"Okay, coming-out party for evolution. That's somehow scarier."

Hale speaks for the first time. "Is necessary because hiding creates more problems than revealing."

"Like what?"

"James Holbrook. People who think invisible art is criminal instead of beautiful."

"People who think connection beyond normal perception is delusional instead of real," Chloe adds.

Maria looks at them. Really looks. At the way they sit—not touching but synchronized. At the way they respond to each other—completing thoughts, mirroring movements. At the light that seems to gather around them when they're together.

"You two really see things others don't?"

"We see differently."

"Show me."

Chloe and Hale exchange glances. Nonverbal communication in frequencies Maria can't access.

"Okay. But you have to trust us. What we show you might not make sense until you see the whole context."

"Show me."

Hale pulls out his modified UV flashlight. Chloe arranges her seventeen pencils in precise spiral on Maria's table.

"First—the arrangement. What does this look like to you?"

"Seventeen pencils in a spiral."

"Now this." Hale clicks on the UV light, shines it on seemingly blank section of wall.

Words appear: *För Maria som kanske förstår* - For Maria who might understand.

"Holy shit," Maria breathes.

"He painted that this morning. While you were in the shower. You never saw him, but he was here."

"That's—how is that possible?"

"UV paint invisible to normal vision but visible under proper lighting. Combined with access most people don't notice."

"Maintenance people are invisible," Hale explains. "Until they want to be seen."

Maria stares at the glowing words. "What do they say?"

"For Maria who might understand."

"Understand what?"

"That some things exist whether or not you can see them. That friendship means supporting friends even when their reality seems impossible."

"That love operates on more frequencies than normal people access," Hale adds.

"And that we need help making those frequencies visible to others."

Maria sits back. "The exhibition."

"The exhibition."

"When?"

"December fifteenth. Opening night of student show."

"Two and a half weeks."

"Is enough time?"

"To revolutionize how people think about perception? Probably not."

"To plant seeds. To make start."

"To prove invisible doesn't mean nonexistent."

Maria looks at them. At the wall where Swedish words glow under UV light. At the spiral of pencils that somehow mirrors invisible meaning.

"What do you need from me?"

"Gallery space. UV lighting equipment. Audience willing to expand their assumptions."

"And protection. In case James Holbrook tries to sabotage."

"I can do gallery space and equipment. Audience might be trickier."

"Why?"

"Because what you're asking for isn't just art exhibition. It's paradigm shift. You're asking people to accept that human perception is evolving. That some individuals see reality others can't access. That connection can transcend normal sensory experience."

"Yes."

"That's terrifying for most people."

"Being different is always terrifying for people who aren't."

"But necessary for people who are."

Maria nods slowly. "Okay. But we do this carefully. Scientifically. With proper context and explanation. Not 'look at the freaks' but 'look at the future.'"

"The future?"

"If you two are proof that human perception is evolving, then you're not anomalies. You're previews. Early indicators of where we're all heading."

Chloe feels something click into place. Not just personal vindication but historical significance.

"We're not just making our connection visible."

"We're documenting perceptual evolution."

"Proving that impossible becomes possible through time and acceptance."

"Making space for others who see differently."

They look at each other across Maria's table. Three people planning revolution through art. Evolution through visibility. Change through refusal to hide.

"December fifteenth," Maria says.

"December fifteenth," they agree.

"This is either going to be beautiful or catastrophic."

"Probably both."

"Definitely both."

"But worth it?"

"Everything worth doing involves risk."

"Then let's risk everything."

The UV light clicks off. The Swedish words disappear from normal view.

But the commitment remains visible.
The plan solidifies.
The revolution begins.

Twenty-two months of unconscious communication
Two months of conscious collaboration
Two and a half weeks until public revelation.

Everything changes.
Everything begins.
Everything becomes visible.
