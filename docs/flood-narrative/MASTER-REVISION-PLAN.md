# MASTER REVISION PLAN: "Things We Lost in the Flood"
## Using Five Power Moves for 99th Percentile Fiction

---

## THE REVISION PHILOSOPHY

Transform flat exposition into visceral experience through systematic application of five power moves, creating fiction that works at line, scene, and structural levels simultaneously.

**Core Principle:** Every 250 words must contain a beat turn or subtext reversal. No dead air.

---

## PHASE 1: STRUCTURAL CAUSAL WEAVE (Week 1)
*Fix the skeleton before the skin*

### Backward Engineering Process

**ENDING LOCKED:** Exhibition reveals unconscious conversation + Holbrook's theft + love is real

**Working Backwards - Major Hinges:**
1. Exhibition happens BECAUSE they created art together
2. Created art BECAUSE reunion proved connection real
3. Reunion happened BECAUSE Maria called Chloe about new paintings
4. New paintings existed BECAUSE Hale never stopped believing
5. Separation happened BECAUSE different helicopters
6. Helicopters came BECAUSE they survived the night
7. Survived BECAUSE found each other in tower
8. Found each other BECAUSE emergency lights revealed UV
9. UV paintings existed BECAUSE Hale was invisible
10. Hale invisible BECAUSE false accusation
11. False accusation BECAUSE Derek protecting Holbrook
12. Chloe present BECAUSE anxiety kept her on campus
13. Anxiety BECAUSE tetrachromacy overwhelms

**Every scene must contain THEREFORE or BUT, never AND THEN**

### Chapter-by-Chapter Causal Markers

**Chapter 1:** Chloe returns BECAUSE Maria called THEREFORE she sees fresh UV
**Chapter 2:** Storm coming BUT both stay BECAUSE unconscious conversation compels
**Chapter 3:** Following UV trail THEREFORE finds Hale BUT doesn't trust reality
**Chapter 4:** Power fails THEREFORE UV visible THEREFORE recognition
**Chapter 5:** Phone call proves real BUT tomorrow's meeting holds answers
**Chapter 6:** Trapped together THEREFORE truth emerges BUT water rising
**Chapter 7:** Kiss BECAUSE think they'll die BUT water stops
**Chapter 8:** Searching BECAUSE separated BUT orbiting unconsciously
**Chapter 9:** Reunion THEREFORE testing real BUT fear of trauma bond
**Chapter 10:** Separation flashback explains WHY twenty months apart
**Chapter 11:** Testing connection THEREFORE kiss THEREFORE real
**Chapter 12:** Evacuation centers show parallel desperation
**Chapter 13:** Creating together THEREFORE love deepens
**Chapter 14:** Search montage proves devotion
**Chapter 15:** Family dinner THEREFORE acceptance BUT heat building
**Chapter 16:** Exhibition THEREFORE validation THEREFORE future

## PHASE 2: PRIVILEGED PERCEPTION LAYER (Week 2)
*Make every chapter contain asymmetric knowledge*

### Systematic Implementation

**Every Chapter Gets:**
- 1 failed witness test (minimum)
- 3 privileged perception beats
- Varied sense channels (not just visual)

### Chapter-Specific Privileged Perception Plans

**Chapter 1: Return**
- **Visual:** UV messages only she sees
- **Failed test:** Brad's gaze slides past blazing letters
- **Thermal:** Seventeen warms in empty chair
- **Button:** "Emma won't see it"

**Chapter 2: Last Normal Day**
- **Visual:** Shimmer between her and Hale across lagoon
- **Failed test:** Marcus almost sees green-gold light
- **Temporal:** Lightning reveals UV for split second
- **Button:** "He won't remember seeing it"

**Chapter 3: Library**
- **Auditory:** UV paint hums at frequency only she hears
- **Failed test:** Student worker doesn't hear the hum
- **Tactile:** Paint feels alive under her fingers
- **Button:** "The warmth is only for her"

**Chapter 4: Power Failure**
- **THE BIG REVEAL:** Multiple failed tests as others can't see UV even in emergency light
- **Synesthetic:** Colors have taste/sound/texture
- **Failed test:** "You see them?" / Others see nothing
- **Button:** "I'm the only one who can"

**Chapter 5: Tower Call**
- **Semantic:** Words rearrange themselves for her
- **Failed test:** Photo shows blank wall to others
- **Moral:** Lies create visual static only she perceives
- **Button:** "Truth looks different through broken eyes"

### Template for Each Beat:
1. **Cue** (normal reality)
2. **Tilt** (anomaly only Chloe perceives)
3. **Human anchor** (witness who should confirm)
4. **Test/abort** (attempt to share)
5. **Button** (isolation confirmed)

---

## PHASE 3: DOUBLE-ENCODED SCENES (Week 3)
*Every conversation runs on two tracks*

### Key Scenes for Double Encoding

**Chapter 6: Trapped Together**
- **Surface:** Discussing how to survive flood
- **Underneath:** Confessing everything they've hidden
- **Irony:** Readers know they're falling in love while characters think they're dying

**Chapter 9: Reunion**
- **Surface:** "Discussing the research project"
- **Underneath:** "Are you real? Was it real?"
- **Irony:** Both terrified while appearing professional

**Chapter 11: Testing Real**
- **Surface:** "Mixing paint colors"
- **Underneath:** "Testing if we're trauma bonded"
- **Irony:** Creating art while questioning connection

**Chapter 15: Family Dinner**
- **Surface:** "Meeting the parents"
- **Underneath:** "Proving I'm not dangerous"
- **Irony:** Parents worry about wrong dangers

### Double-Encoding Template:
```
Surface Goal: [What characters claim to want]
Hidden Agenda: [What they actually want]
Reader Knowledge: [What we know that someone doesn't]
Dialogue That Works Both Ways: [Lines with double meaning]
Surface Winner: [Who "wins" the stated conflict]
Underneath Loss: [What's actually lost]
```

## PHASE 4: FREE INDIRECT STYLE (Week 4)
*Eliminate filter verbs, fuse narration with consciousness*

### Systematic Filter Verb Elimination

**KILL LIST:**
- She saw → [describe what's there]
- She noticed → [describe the thing]
- She realized → [state the realization]
- She felt → [describe the sensation]
- She thought → [state the thought]
- She knew → [state the knowledge]
- She wondered → [ask the question]
- She remembered → [show the memory]

### Chapter-by-Chapter Free Indirect Conversions

**Chapter 1 Before:**
> She saw UV paint on the door. She noticed it was Swedish.

**Chapter 1 After:**
> UV paint blazed on the door. Swedish—those little crowns on the vowels.

**Chapter 4 Before:**
> She realized she could see the paintings. She felt overwhelmed.

**Chapter 4 After:**
> The paintings. Everywhere. All for her. The room spun, colors screaming frequencies that shouldn't exist.

**Chapter 11 Before:**
> She thought about their connection. She wondered if it was real.

**Chapter 11 After:**
> Trauma bond or true love? The question tasted copper-bitter on her tongue.

### Free Indirect Checklist:
- [ ] Character diction bleeds into narration
- [ ] No "she thought" brackets
- [ ] Zoom tight for heat, wide for irony
- [ ] Voice IS plot
- [ ] Judgment embedded in description

## PHASE 5: KINETIC MODULAR STRUCTURE (Week 5)
*Phone-native pacing, micro-beats every 250 words*

### Restructuring for Modern Readers

**Target Metrics:**
- Paragraph: 1-4 sentences max
- White space every 150-300 words
- Micro-cliffhanger every section
- Visual variety on page
- Scannable blocks

### Sample Restructure - Chapter 1

**BEFORE (Wall of text):**
> The bathroom stall door had something written on it that only Chloe could see. It was in Swedish, and she knew it was meant for her. She had been seeing things like this since the flood, messages that others couldn't perceive, and she wasn't sure if she was going crazy or if something else was happening.

**AFTER (Kinetic modules):**
> The stall door blazed with hooked letters.
> 
> Swedish maybe—those little crowns on the vowels.
> 
> In the next stall, someone crying. Emma from orientation. The toilet flushes. Footsteps approach.
> 
> Chloe's hand rises to the latch. She could ask. Point. Say *look*.
> 
> She lets it fall.
> 
> Emma won't see it.

### Beat Structure for Each Module:
1. **Image** (concrete visual/sensory)
2. **Tilt** (something shifts)
3. **Micro-choice** (small decision)
4. **Button line** (punchy ending)

## MANTRA FOR REVISION

*Every line must move plot or reveal character, preferably both.*
*Every beat must cause the next beat.*
*Every scene must run on two tracks.*
*Every chapter must contain what others can't perceive.*
*Every word must earn its place.*

**No dead air. No flat telling. No filter verbs. No "and then."**

**Only therefore, but, because, despite.**

**Make the invisible visible through failure to share it.**
