# SPECIFIC FIXES IMPLEMENTATION
## Line-by-Line Corrections

---

## 1. CHAPTER 12 - Timeline & Location Fix

**Line 105 - LOCATION FIX:**
- CURRENT: "Hale stands in what was the carillon tower"
- CHANGE TO: "Hale stands in what was Storke Tower's carillon room"

---

## 2. CHAPTER 3 - Add Holbrook Foreshadowing

**Insert after line describing UV gallery discovery:**

```
She pulls out her phone to document it. Searches "UV art Santa Barbara" to understand.

A news article from last year catches her eye—'Gallery Owner's Son Cleared in Vandalism Case.' James Holbrook. The name means nothing to her. Yet.

But there's something about the case—accusations of stealing another artist's work, UV techniques mentioned. She screenshots it without knowing why.
```

---

## 3. CHAPTER 9 - Coffee Shop Holbrook Hint

**Add after they sit down at coffee shop:**

```
The coffee shop walls display local art. One piece has a small gallery sticker in the corner: 'Holbrook Contemporary.' 

Hale's jaw tightens when he sees it. His heat signature spikes—anger-orange bleeding into the seventeen warms.

"You know that gallery?" she asks.

"Later," he says. Not avoiding. Promising.
```

---

## 4. CHAPTER 13 - Tommy's Warning

**Add when Tommy brings vinyl records:**

```
"Oh, and heads up," Tommy says, setting down the last crate. "That Holbrook kid—James—he's been sniffing around. Asking about Swedish artists doing UV work. His dad owns like three galleries."

Hale's hand stills on the Bathory record.

"When?"

"Last week. Maybe Tuesday? I told him I didn't know anything, but he seemed pretty interested. Watch your back, yeah?"

The seventeen warms in Chloe's palms pulse with new frequency—protective-red mixed with worry-purple.
```

---

## 5. CHAPTER 1 - Maria's Subtle Knowledge

**Line adjustment when Maria is mentioned:**

CURRENT: "Maria from orientation"
CHANGE TO: "Maria from orientation, whose expression does something quick—recognition?—before settling into helpful concern."

**When discussing the paintings:**
ADD: "Maria's phone buzzes. She glances at it, then at Chloe with an expression that's almost... knowing? But it passes too quick to read."

---

## 6. CHAPTER 11 - Add Chloe's Counting

**Insert during the testing scene:**

```
She waits for his answer. Counts without meaning to—one Mississippi, two Mississippi—up to seventeen. Always seventeen when waiting for him. The compulsion stronger when anxious, but with him it feels like rhythm, not symptom.

"Seventeen seconds," she says.

"What?"

"You took seventeen seconds to answer. Our number even in time."
```

---

## 7. CHAPTER 13 - Counting Addition

**When creating dictionary:**

```
"Forty-three," she announces.

"Forty-three what?"

"New words we've created. I count. Can't not count. The compulsion gets stronger when we're creating—like my brain needs to catalog everything we make."

He smiles. "Good number. Matches how many greens I see in your eyes."

"You can't see forty-three greens."

"No. But I can paint them because you describe them."
```

---

## 8. CHAPTER 15 - Family Dinner Counting

**Add to kitchen scene with mother:**

```
Her mother adds another ingredient to the mole. "Twenty-seven in total."

"Twenty-seven," Chloe repeats, arranging the empty spice jars in spectrum order. "I counted."

"You always count, mija. Since you were little. Every ingredient, every color, every breath when anxious."

"It's worse when I'm nervous."

"And now?"

Chloe realizes she's been counting steadily but calmly. "Twenty-seven ingredients. Seventeen warms from him. Twelve variations of white in these tiles. But it's... quiet counting. Not screaming counting."
```

---

## 9. HALE'S SWEDISH PATTERNS

**Chapter 6 - When stressed in tower:**
- "Water is at third step" → "Water at third step now"
- "We should try the roof" → "Should try roof"

**Chapter 9 - When calm at coffee:**
- Keep articles: "The paintings are responses"
- Formal: "It is difficult to explain, no?"

**Chapter 11 - When intimate:**
- "Du är mitt ljus" (add when kissing)
- "Is good. Is us. Is real."

---

## 10. SUPPORTING CHARACTER VOICES

- Chapter 1: "Ay, mija, you look like you've seen a ghost"
- Chapter 8: "Dios mío, we looked everywhere for you"
- Chapter 14: "Cálmate, breathe, he's real"

### Tommy Additions:
- Chapter 13: "That's first pressing energy right there"

### Dr. Tanaka Additions:
- "The wavelength measures exactly 432.7 nanometers"

## 11. NUMBER VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

✓ All "seventeen warms" references consistent
✓ Kiss at 2:15 AM (not 2:13)
✓ 497 paintings/arrangements
✓ 37-degree angle for UV visibility
✓ 61 bells in Storke Tower carillon
✓ 93 as flood number

---

## 12. LOCATION ACCURACY FINAL CHECK

### Every Tower Reference Should Be:
- "Storke Tower" - the building
- "The carillon room" - where trapped

- NEVER "Carillon Tower" alone

### Other UCSB Locations Verified:
- Davidson Library ✓
- Campus Lagoon ✓
- UCen (University Center) ✓
- The Arbor ✓
- San Rafael and San Miguel Residence Halls ✓
