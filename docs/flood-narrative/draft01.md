# Frequencies Only She Can See
*September 17, 2024 - Twenty Months After the Flood*

---

## Part 1: The Bathroom Discovery

The bathroom stall door blazes with hooked letters.

Swedish maybe—those little crowns floating above the vowels. But wrong. Like someone wrote them underwater, or dying, or both. The UV paint shouldn't be visible in normal light, but the afternoon sun hits at exactly thirty-seven degrees through the narrow window, and for three minutes each day, the invisible becomes—

"You okay in there?"

Emma from orientation. Pottery major. Can't see purple when it's right in front of her.

"Fine." Chloe's hand hovers over the latch.

"You sure? You've been in there a while."

"Period stuff," Chloe lies. Universal excuse. Conversation ender.

"Oh. Do you need—?"

"I'm good."

 She could open the door.  Point. Say *look at the door. Tell me what you see.*

Her hand drops.

BECAUSE Emma won't see it.
THEREFORE Chloe stays silent.
BUT the message pulses like it's alive.

The toilet in the next stall flushes. Footsteps approach the sinks. Safe now to emerge. Chloe opens the door, walks to the mirror, doesn't look at Emma washing clay from her fingernails—gray clay that's actually seventeen different grays if you count the ultraviolet spectrum bleeding through, but who's counting?

She is. Always counting colors that don't have names.

Footsteps retreat to the next stall. Lock clicking. Safe now to study the message without looking insane.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Swedish. She's Googled enough Swedish phrases in the last twenty months to recognize the structure. The crowns over the a's—å's technically. The way the words flow like water themselves.

Find me where the water began.

Her mind translates the letters into taste—copper-salt-snow. His taste. She knows it's his without knowing how she knows. Twenty months since the flood, since the tower, since eight hours of thinking they'd die, and she still tastes his words like memory on her tongue.

"Oh my god," Emma says from the next stall. "Did you see Marcus's post about the lagoon thing?"

"What?" Chloe forces herself to respond. Normal. Be normal.

"The commemoration. For the flood anniversary. Well, not anniversary—that was January. But like, for fall semester people who weren't here then?"

The toilet flushes. Footsteps to sink. Chloe counts to five, opens her stall door, walks to the mirrors. Doesn't look at Emma washing clay from her fingernails—gray clay that's actually seventeen different grays if you count the ultraviolet spectrum bleeding through each particle.

"He wants everyone there by four," Emma continues, working soap through her fingers. "Some kind of healing circle thing. Very Marcus."

Marcus. Philosophy major. Thinks trauma can be "processed" through "community witnessing." Wasn't here during the flood. Doesn't understand that some things can't be witnessed because they exist in frequencies others can't see.

"I have a thing," Chloe says.

"Come on. I know you were here during—" Emma stops. Recalculates. Her reflection shows the careful expression people get when they remember Chloe is Category Five Trauma—trapped in tower, nearly drowned, lost someone.

"Sorry. I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine."

"It's just, Marcus says communal healing—"

"I really do have a thing."

Emma rinses her hands. The water runs clear but Chloe sees the mineral content—twelve different compounds, each with its own spectral signature. Santa Barbara water. Different from before the flood. Everything's different after.

"Is it about him?" Emma asks suddenly.

"What?"

"The guy. The one you lost that night."

Chloe's throat closes. "How did you—?"

"Maria told me. Not details. Just that there was someone. That you've been looking."

Maria. Of course. Trying to help by spreading just enough information that people understand why Chloe photographs blank walls and arranges objects obsessively.

"He wasn't—we weren't—" How to explain? Eight hours of connection during disaster. A kiss that tasted like ending. Twenty months of searching for someone whose name was recorded wrong. "It's complicated."

"Love during trauma always is."

Love. The word hangs between them like UV paint—invisible to Emma, screaming to Chloe.

Emma dries her hands. "If you change your mind about the lagoon—"

"I won't."

"But if you do—"

"Emma." Chloe turns from the mirror. "I can't. The lagoon is where—where the water—"

"Where it began. I know. Maria told me that too."

Where it began. The same words from the UV message. Coincidence? Or is Emma seeing something she doesn't realize she's seeing?

"You keep looking at the stall door," Emma says.

Chloe freezes.

"Is there something—?"

"Graffiti. Someone wrote something gross."

"Ugh. People are disgusting." Emma doesn't look. Doesn't verify. Just accepts. "I'll report it to maintenance."

"No!" Too sharp. Chloe softens. "I mean, I already did. They're coming tomorrow."

"Cool." Emma heads for the door. Pauses. "Chloe? I know we don't know each other well, but if you ever want to talk about him—the guy from the flood—I'm here."

"Thanks."

Emma leaves. The bathroom empties. The afternoon light shifts—3:49 PM. One minute left of visibility.

Chloe returns to the stall. Studies the message. Takes a photo, though she knows the UV won't show up on her phone's camera. Only her eyes can capture this frequency.

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

The water began at the library. Ground floor. Where she first saw his UV paintings three years ago, before she knew who created them, before the flood, before everything.

3:50 PM. The light shifts. The message disappears.

But the taste of copper-salt-snow remains.

## Part 2: The Shimmer at Thirty-Seven Degrees

Outside, September heat slams into her like memory.

Not just heat—seventeen different temperatures, her skin mapping microclimates. The eucalyptus trees read 74.3°F in shade, 89.7°F in sun. The concrete burns at 97.2°F through her shoes. The air itself has layers—ground heat at 91°F, chest level at 88°F, the breath-space at 86.4°F.

"Yo, Martinez!"

Brad. Modernism seminar. Thinks Pollock was overrated. Currently leaning against eucalyptus tree, rolling a joint with practiced precision.

"You coming to Marcus's circle jerk at the lagoon?"

"That's not what he called it."

"Might as well be. 'Healing through communal witnessing.' Fucking please." He lights up, takes a drag. "Like anybody who wasn't here could understand."

He was here. She remembers now—his name on survivor lists. Engineering building. Different evacuation route. Still has nightmares, probably, but performs cynicism like armor.

"You going?" she asks.

"Fuck no. I don't need to sit in a circle and share my trauma with people who think flooding is when their basement gets damp."

The tree behind him shimmers.

Not the heat-wave kind of shimmer. Something else. Like reality hiccupping in frequencies that taste purple-gold-silver. She's been seeing it for weeks now, always in peripheral vision, always in places where—

"You okay? You're doing that thing."

"What thing?"

"The staring at nothing thing. The counting colors that aren't there thing."

"They're there. You just can't see them."

"Right. Your superpower." He offers her the joint. "This might help. Or make it worse. Probably worse."

"I'm good."

"You're something." He studies her. "Maria says you're looking for someone."

Christ. Maria's told everyone.

"She's worried about you," Brad continues. "Says you've been creating patterns. Leaving breadcrumbs for someone who might not exist."

"He exists."

"How do you know?"

"Because—" She looks at the shimmer behind him. Stronger now. Pulsing. "Because I can see his work."

"His work?"

"UV paintings. Messages. He's been leaving them where he knew I'd look."

Brad's expression shifts. "That's either romantic as fuck or creepy as hell."

"It's neither. It's just—communication."

"With someone you haven't seen in twenty months?"

"Yes."

"Someone whose name you don't know?"

"I know his name. The records had it wrong."

"Someone who might be dead?"

The shimmer explodes into recognizable pattern. Not random. Deliberate. Arrow-shaped, pointing toward—

"I have to go," she says.

"The library?" Brad's not stupid. Sees her trajectory. "That's where you're going? Where it flooded worst?"

"Where the water began."

"Jesus. You're all crazy. Every one of you tower survivors."

Maybe. But crazy doesn't make it less real.

She walks away. Behind her, Brad calls out: "If you find him—your ghost or whatever—ask him if he has a sister!"

She doesn't respond. The shimmer-trail leads straight to the library, growing stronger with each step.

---

## Part 3: Maria's Discovery

Her phone buzzes. Maria. Again.

"Don't go to the lagoon thing."

"Wasn't planning to."

"Good. But also, you need to see something."

"Maria—"

"Library. Lower level. Now."

"Why?"

"Just come. Trust me. It's about the paintings."

The UV paintings. The ones she's been photographing for weeks without telling anyone she can actually see them. The ones that appear overnight and disappear by morning, painted over by maintenance but somehow returning.

"Which paintings?"

"The ghost ones. The ones you pretend you can't see but totally can."

"Maria—"

"I know you see things differently, Chloe."

World stops. "What?"

"Your mom told me. When I called her after you wouldn't stop looking for Swedish guys named Lars. She explained about the four cones. The UV vision. The hundred million colors thing."

"She had no right—"

"She's worried. I'm worried. Everyone's worried."

"I'm fine."

"You arrange pencils for hours. You photograph blank walls. You see things that aren't there."

"They are there. Just because you can't see them—"

"That's my point. Come to the library. There's someone else here who can."

"What?"

"See them. The paintings. He's been adding to them. And Chloe? He's Swedish."

The phone slips. She catches it. "What did you say?"

"Tall. Blonde. Swedish accent. Has paint under his fingernails—I can see that much even with my inferior three-cone vision."

"Maria—"

"He's here now. Studying the walls like they're speaking to him."

They are. The same way they speak to her. In frequencies that don't exist for anyone else.

"Don't let him leave."

"Wasn't planning to. But Chloe? He looks exactly like how you described your tower ghost."

Not ghost. Never ghost. Just lost. Like her.

She runs.

---

## Part 4: The Library Descent

The library still smells like flood.

They've replaced everything—carpet, walls, books—but water has memory, and that memory lives in frequencies beyond smell. Her synesthesia translates it into color: gray-green-brown with edges of metallic yellow. The taste of disaster on her tongue.

The stairs to the lower level are new but feel old. Each step down increases the shimmer in her peripheral vision. By the time she reaches the bottom, it's almost unbearable—purple-gold-silver screaming at frequencies that make her teeth ache.

Maria waits by the new age philosophy section. Somehow that survived—universe's joke. Books about crystals and energy when real energy moves in UV wavelengths through painted walls.

"Finally," Maria says. "He's been here for an hour. Just staring. Adding little touches with—is that UV paint?"

Chloe can't answer. Can't breathe. Because there he is.

Tall. Pale. Swedish angles she's drawn from memory a thousand times. Paint under his fingernails—seventeen different colors including UV frequencies that scream recognition through her impossible eyes.

He's facing the wall, adding something. Small strokes. Delicate. Swedish words she'll translate later but already understands.

"That's him," she whispers.

"You sure?"

"Seventeen."

"What?"

"He has seventeen different temperatures. Nobody else has seventeen."

Maria looks at her like she's lost it. Maybe she has. But he turns—maybe heard her, maybe felt her presence the way she feels his—and his eyes (green that's actually forty-three different greens if you map the spectrum) widen with recognition that transcends twenty months of separation.

"Chloe?"

Her name in his accent. The same voice from the tower. From eight hours of thinking they'd die. From promises made in emergency lighting while water rose.

"Hale."

Not a question. Recognition.

"You can see them." His voice breaks slightly. "The paintings. You've been seeing them all along."

"You're the ghost."

"And you're the one who's been answering."

"What?" Maria looks between them. "Answering how?"

But Chloe understands. The patterns she's been creating. The arrangements. The photographs posted to Instagram. She's been responding to his UV messages without conscious knowledge. Twenty months of call and response in frequencies only they can perceive.

"The pencil arrangement on August ninth," he says. "Seventeen pencils in spiral pattern."

"The day you painted seventeen spirals here."

"The stones by the lagoon on September first."

"Matching your UV stars on the bathroom doors."

"The library books on Monday."

"Echoing your Swedish poem on the study carrels."

They're both talking now, overlapping, cataloging months of unconscious conversation. Maria stares like they're insane.

"Wait," she interrupts. "You're saying you two have been unconsciously communicating through art?"

"Not unconsciously," Hale says, not looking away from Chloe. "Superconsciously. Above regular consciousness. In frequencies that only exist between us."

"That's impossible."

"Look at the wall," Chloe says.

Maria looks. Sees beige paint. Maybe some water stains.

"Now look through this." Chloe hands her phone with UV filter app.

The wall explodes into visibility—layers of paint, Swedish words, mathematical patterns, and in the center, painted just today: a portrait. Not realistic. Impressionistic. But unmistakably Chloe, rendered in wavelengths that shouldn't exist.

"Holy shit," Maria breathes.

"He's been painting me. Without seeing me. For months."

"And she's been arranging responses. Without knowing. Creating patterns that match my paintings exactly."

"How?"

They look at each other across ten feet of flood-damaged library. The shimmer between them solidifies into something almost visible—threads of connection in UV spectrum, pulsing with twenty months of searching, finding, losing, creating.

"I don't know," Chloe admits.

"Does it matter?" Hale asks.

"You two are freaking me out," Maria says. "Also, this is beautiful. Also, what the fuck?"

---

## Part 5: The Recognition Dance

They stand frozen. Ten feet apart. The space between them shimmers with possibility and fear.

"Twenty months," she says.

"Five hundred ninety-three days," he corrects.

"You counted?"

"Every one."

"I searched—"

"I know. Me too. Wrong name in the records."

"Lars Holstrom."

"You found that?"

"I found seventeen different Lars variants. None were you."

"Seventeen." He almost smiles. "Always seventeen with us."

"What happened? After the helicopters?"

"Different evacuation routes. They took me to County General. You?"

"Red Cross station at the convention center."

"I checked there. Day three."

"I was gone. They moved anyone with hypothermia to—"

"Cottage Hospital."

"You checked there too?"

"I checked everywhere. But they had your name as C. Matthews. Some registration error."

"And yours as Lars Holstrom."

"The Danish volunteer. Couldn't understand my accent through the hypothermia."

Maria clears her throat. "Okay, I need backstory. You two were in the tower together?"

"Eight hours," Chloe says.

"While it flooded," Hale adds.

"And you—what? Fell in love while drowning?"

They look at each other. How to explain? The UV gallery he'd painted. The moment she saw colors he created for eyes he didn't know existed. The seventeen warms. The kiss that tasted like ending but was beginning.

"It's more complicated than that," Chloe says.

"Much more," Hale agrees.

"Try me."

Chloe takes a breath. "I have tetrachromacy. Four color cones instead of three. I can see a hundred million colors, including UV spectrum."

"And I paint in UV," Hale continues. "Have been for three years. Creating art for eyes I didn't know existed."

"Until the flood."

"Until her."

"We found each other in the tower. In the dark. Through art I could see and he could create."

"And then lost each other for twenty months."

"But kept creating."

"Kept faith."

"Even when everyone said—"

"That the other was dead. Or gone. Or never existed."

They're finishing each other's sentences now. Maria watches like it's tennis, back and forth, two people finding their rhythm after long separation.

"So these paintings..." Maria gestures at the wall.

"Love letters," Hale says simply. "In frequencies only she can read."

"And my arrangements?"

"Responses," Chloe admits. "In patterns only he would recognize."

"You've been having a conversation for months without knowing."

"Without conscious knowing," Hale corrects. "Some part knew. The part that paints. That creates. That believes beyond logic."

The shimmer between them intensifies. Chloe takes a step forward. He matches it. Eight feet apart now.

"The message in the bathroom," she says. "Where the water began."

"You saw it."

"Thirty-seven degree angle. 3:47 PM."

"You know the exact angle?"

"I know all your angles. Been mapping them for months."

"The water began here," he says. "In the library. Where you first saw my work."

"Three years ago. October third. You painted 'For someone who might feel.'"

His breath catches. "You remember the title?"

"I remember everything. Every UV stroke. Every impossible color. Every message you left for eyes that might not exist."

"They exist." He takes another step. "You exist."

Six feet apart.

"I thought I hallucinated you," she admits. "Trauma response. My therapist said—"

"Mine too. That you were projection. Coping mechanism. False memory."

"But you kept painting."

"You kept arranging."

"Even when it felt insane."

"Especially then."

Four feet apart.

Maria backs away. "I feel like I should leave you two alone, but also I can't look away."

They don't hear her. The shimmer between them has become almost solid—UV threads connecting across space, visible only to eyes that can see beyond visible.

"I have something to tell you," he says.

"About the paintings?"

"About James Holbrook. The accusation."

Chloe tenses. She'd heard rumors. Sexual harassment claims. Then retraction.

"He lied," Hale says simply. "Admitted it last month. His father made him. Wanted me gone because I wouldn't sell through their gallery."

"So you're cleared?"

"Completely. But I stayed hidden anyway."

"Why?"

"Because being visible meant being findable. And being findable meant admitting you might not be looking."

Two feet apart. Close enough she can feel his heat—seventeen different temperatures radiating like personal aurora. Close enough to smell oil paint and Swedish pine and something that translates as home in frequencies that don't have words.

"I never stopped looking," she says.

"I know." He reaches out. Stops. "Can I—?"

She takes his hand.

---

## Part 6: The Touch Symphony

[Privileged perception - all senses exploding]

Contact.

Her synesthesia detonates into symphony—seventeen temperatures through seventeen fingers (wait, that math doesn't work but nothing about them follows rules). His palm at 98.7°F, fingertips at 97.2°F, the pulse point at his wrist blazing at 99.1°F. Each temperature translates to color: warm amber, cool silver, hot gold, all mixing into something that tastes like copper-mint-snow.

"Seventeen," she breathes.

"What?"

"You're still seventeen. Different temperatures. Always seventeen. I thought maybe I'd imagined—"

"You didn't imagine anything."

"The kiss. In the tower."

"Real."

"The colors when we touched."

"I saw them too."

"That's impossible. You can't actually see them."

"No. But when we touch—" He squeezes her hand. "I see edges. Borders. Like you're lending me your eyes."

"Or we're creating new frequencies together."

Maria makes a sound. They'd forgotten she was there.

"Sorry," Maria says. "This is just—intensely beautiful and completely impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible," Chloe says, not looking away from Hale.

"Impossible but real," he adds.

"Real because impossible."

"That makes no sense."

"We make no sense."

They're standing so close now the shimmer between them has nowhere to go but through them—UV light bouncing between their bodies, creating feedback loops of impossible color.

"I painted you," he says suddenly. "Every day. These twenty months."

"I know. I can see them. All of them. Layers on the walls."

"No. I mean—" He pulls up his sleeve.

Scars. Precise. Geometric. But that's not what makes her gasp.

It's the UV paint tattooed over them. Invisible to everyone else. Blazing to her. Seventeen parallel lines that tell the story of their separation in frequencies only she can read.

"You marked yourself."

"Where only you could see. If you existed. If you came back."

"I existed. I came back."

"I know." His free hand touches her face. Seventeen more temperatures. Seventeen more colors. "You're here."

"We're here."

"After twenty months."

"Five hundred ninety-three days."

"Who's counting?"

"Both of us. Always."

Maria clears her throat. "Not to interrupt this gorgeous reunion, but there's something else you should see."

She points to the far wall. New paint. Still wet. Not Hale's work—different hand, different style.

Words in UV: "THIEF. FAKER. HOLBROOK KNOWS."

"Shit," Hale breathes.

"James?" Chloe asks.

"He must have followed me. Knows I'm here. Knows I'm painting."

"But he can't see UV."

"No. But—" Hale walks to the message, studies it. "This isn't UV. It's blacklight paint. Similar but different. He's guessing. Trying to—"

Footsteps on the stairs. Heavy. Angry. Multiple people.

"Speak of the devil," Maria mutters.

James Holbrook descends with two security guards. Tall, moneyed, the kind of handsome that reads as trustworthy until you see the frequencies underneath—Chloe's impossible vision reveals microexpressions invisible to others. Rage. Entitlement. Danger.

"There he is," James says. "The vandal. The faker. The—" He sees Chloe. Stops. "You. You're with him?"

"We're together," Chloe says.

"You don't even know him. What he is."

"I know exactly what he is."

"A liar. A thief. Stealing my aesthetic—"

"You paint in oils," Hale says quietly. "Traditional spectrum. I paint in UV. We don't overlap."

"UV isn't real art. It's gimmick. Invisible nonsense for people who want to feel special."

"It's real to those who can see it."

"No one can see it!"

"I can," Chloe says.

James laughs. "Right. You're one of those people who claim to see special colors."

"I do see them."

"Prove it."

Chloe looks at the wall. Reads the UV messages aloud—not the Swedish (though she knows it now) but the English. Word for word. Messages painted in frequencies James can't perceive.

His face changes. "You watched him paint them."

"I wasn't here."

"He told you what they say."

"We just reunited. Five minutes ago."

"Then—"

"I have tetrachromacy. Four cones. I see what you can't."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible," Hale says, taking her hand again. "Doesn't make it less real."

Security steps forward. "Sir, we need to check if he's actually vandalizing—"

"He is! The paint—"

"What paint?" The guard shines a flashlight on the walls. Regular light. Shows nothing. "I don't see any vandalism."

"Use a blacklight!"

"We don't have one. And even if we did, UV paint isn't vandalism if it's invisible."

"That's ridiculous!"

"That's policy. No visible damage, no crime."

James turns red. Well, seventeen different reds to Chloe's eyes, each one a different frequency of rage.

"This isn't over," he tells Hale. "You think you're clever with your invisible art, but—"

"It's over," Hale says quietly. "You admitted you lied about the harassment. Your father disowned you. You have no gallery, no influence, no power. It's over."

"I'll tell everyone you're crazy. Both of you. Seeing things that aren't there."

"Good luck with that," Maria interjects. "I've got the whole thing on video. You harassing two flood survivors about their art project. Very sympathetic."

James storms out. Security follows, apologizing.

The library goes quiet.

"So," Maria says. "That was dramatic."

Chloe's still holding Hale's hand. Seventeen warms. Seventeen years she feels like she's been waiting, though it's only been three.

"I should go," Maria adds. "You two clearly need to—talk. Or whatever. Create invisible art babies."

"Maria!"

"What? It's true. You're going to make beautiful Swedish children who see and paint in impossible colors."

She leaves.

They're alone.

---

## Part 7: The Proposition

The shimmer solidifies into something new. Not searching anymore. Finding. Found.

"We should talk," Hale says.

"About?"

"Twenty months. What happened. What happens now."

"Or we could not talk."

"What then?"

"Create. You paint. I'll arrange. See what conversation happens."

"Here?"

"Anywhere. Everywhere." She pulls him toward the wall. "Show me. All of it. Every layer. Every message you left."

He picks up the UV marker. Starts pointing, explaining. Each stroke has a date, a hope, a moment of faith when faith seemed insane.

"This one—day thirty-seven. I thought I saw you at the farmer's market."

"I was in San Francisco. Seeing specialists about my vision."

"This—day one hundred. Your birthday."

"How did you know my birthday?"

"I didn't. Guessed. September fifth?"

"September seventh."

"Close."

"Very."

He continues the tour. She adds context—where she was, what she was arranging, how they were unconsciously synchronized across the city, across months, across impossibility.

"We were having the same conversation," she realizes. "Just in different languages."

"Same frequency, different expression."

"Like—"

"Like we're quantum entangled. Paired particles. Change one, the other responds instantly regardless of distance."

"That's not how quantum entanglement works."

"How do you know?"

"Physics degree. Before art."

"Of course." He smiles. First real smile. It creates seventeen new colors in her peripheral vision. "You're probably going to tell me your vision doesn't work how I think either."

"It doesn't. It's not magic. Just genetics. Extra cone. More color discrimination."

"But the UV—"

"That's unusual. Most people with this ability can't see that far into the spectrum."

"So you're unusual even for unusual."

"Apparently."

"Good. Normal would be boring."

He adds another line to the painting. She watches the UV flow from the marker—can actually see the chemical bonds forming, the paint adhering to wall at molecular level. Her synesthesia translates it to sound: high crystalline note, like glass singing.

"Can you teach me?" she asks.

"To paint UV?"

"To paint what I see."

"I can try. But I don't see what you see."

"No. But when we touch—" She takes his hand again. "You see edges. Borders. Maybe enough."

"You want to create together?"

"We already are. Have been. Just unconsciously."

"And now consciously."

"If you want."

He puts down the marker. Turns to face her fully. The shimmer between them intensifies until even the regular light looks different—bent, refracted, transformed by their proximity.

"I want," he says. "But Chloe—"

"What?"

"Twenty months. We're different people now."

"Are we?"

"Aren't we?"

She thinks about it. The searching. The therapy. The people saying move on, let go, he's gone. But through it all, the constant: arranging colors only she could see, responding to messages she didn't know existed, keeping faith in impossible frequencies.

"I'm exactly the same," she says. "Just more. More colors. More patterns. More sure that invisible doesn't mean alone."

"Invisible doesn't mean alone." He repeats it like prayer. "That's what kept me painting."

"What keeps me arranging."

"Even now? When we're visible to each other?"

"Especially now. Because now someone else can see."

"I could always see. Just didn't know what I was looking at."

"And now?"

"Now I know exactly what I'm looking at."

"Which is?"

He doesn't answer with words. Kisses her instead.

Not like the tower kiss—desperate, ending, goodbye.

This kiss tastes like beginning. Like library dust and UV paint and twenty months of faith made manifest. Her synesthesia explodes—seventeen tastes, seventeen sounds, seventeen new colors being born where their lips meet.

When they part, the wall behind them has changed. The UV paintings glow brighter, as if their kiss charged them with new frequency.

"Did you see that?" she asks.

"The paintings? They shifted."

"You can see them?"

"When we touch. Yes. Edges and borders but—yes."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us—"

"Is impossible. I know. But this is new impossible."

"Good impossible?"

"The best impossible."

He kisses her again. The paintings pulse. The shimmer sings. The library that smells like flood transforms into something else—gallery, laboratory, sacred space where impossible connections manifest in UV light.

"So," he says when they part. "Research project? Document our impossible connection?"

"Document. Create. Prove that invisible art exists."

"Together?"

"Is there any other way?"

"Not for us."

"Not anymore."

They stand in the flood-damaged library, surrounded by UV messages only they can see, planning a future in frequencies that don't exist for anyone else.

The water began here.

The art continues everywhere.

The connection persists in spectrums beyond visible, beyond possible, beyond everything except the truth of two people who found each other through invisible light and refused to let go.

Even when letting go would have been sane.

Especially then.

## Part 1: The Wrong Shimmer

The lagoon shimmers wrong.

Not the surface—that's just wind-rippled water catching afternoon sun. Underneath. In frequencies that make Chloe's teeth ache, like biting aluminum foil but translated to vision.

She sits on the bench where she always sits. Same time every Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Two PM to three-thirty. Arranging her colored pencils in gradients only she can map. Forty-seven distinct shades from white to black, but really three hundred and twelve if you count what bleeds through at this angle.

"That's obsessive, you know."

Brad drops onto the bench beside her. Smells like weed and disaster preparedness—he's been helping board up windows all morning.

"It helps me think," she says.

"About what?"

"Patterns."

"What patterns?"

She gestures vaguely at everything. The lagoon, the trees, the sky that's starting to look diseased around the edges—green-gold infection spreading from the horizon.

"You can't see them?"

"See what? It's just water and sky and—" He pauses. "Wait. Do you see that?"

Her heart jumps. "See what?"

"That shimmer. Like heat waves but... wrong."

"You see it?"

"No. Maybe. Fuck, I don't know." He rubs his eyes. "Been awake too long. Storm prep is making everyone crazy."

But he was looking at the right spot. The exact place where reality hiccups in frequencies she can't name.

"They're saying it'll be bad," he continues. "Like, historically bad. You evacuating?"

"No."

"Why not?"

Because the shimmer has been growing stronger for weeks. Because someone's been leaving messages in invisible paint. Because she needs to know what happens when the storm arrives.

"Nowhere to go," she says instead.

"Parents?"

"Dead."

"Shit. Sorry."

"Long time ago."

They sit in silence. She continues arranging pencils. The pattern feels important—like she's responding to something. Always responding to something she can't quite see.

"Martinez!"

Marcus jogs up, board shorts and flip-flops despite the January cold and approaching catastrophe.

"Storm party at Sigma tonight. Epic end-of-the-world bash. You in?"

"The world's not ending," Brad says.

"Might be. Have you seen the weather models? This thing's a monster."

"It's just rain."

"Biblical rain. Forty days and forty nights rain. Build-an-ark rain."

Brad snorts. "Drama major?"

"Philosophy. But I appreciate theatrical truth."

They argue about storm severity. Chloe stops listening. The shimmer behind Marcus intensifies—purple-silver wrongness that tastes like electricity. She's been seeing it for weeks. Always the same places: library basement, third floor of humanities, the lagoon path. Following a pattern like someone's route through campus.

"Can you see—" She stops. Points at the shimmer.

Both boys turn.

"See what?" Marcus asks.

"That... distortion. In the air."

They squint. Brad tilts his head.

"Maybe?" Brad says. "Like heat waves?"

"In January?" Marcus laughs. "Martinez, how high are you?"

"I'm not—"

"Hey, no judgment. Storm's coming. Get high, get laid, get enlightened. Whatever works."

He jogs off toward the dorms. Brad stays, still staring at where the shimmer dances.

"I might see something," he says quietly. "Or maybe you're making me think I see something. Power of suggestion."

"What does it look like to you?"

"Like... like the air is sick. If that makes sense."

It does. More than he knows.

---

## Part 2: The Pattern Maker

3:00 PM. Brad's gone to help with more storm prep. Chloe remains, pencils now arranged in a spiral that mirrors something she can't name.

"Extraordinary gradient."

The voice comes from behind. Accented. Swedish maybe—those careful consonants like English is formally learned, not naturally acquired.

She doesn't turn. In her peripheral vision where she sees most clearly, he resolves: tall, pale, pushing a maintenance cart that squeaks rhythmically. But he moves wrong for maintenance—too graceful, like the cart is costume.

"Just pencils," she says.

"Not just. Is answering something."

Her hands still. "Answering what?"

"Don't know. But every time I paint, you respond. Three months now. October, November, December. Always answering."

Now she turns. His face is angles and shadows, green eyes that are really forty-three different greens if she counts them all. Paint under his fingernails—seventeen different colors including some that shouldn't be visible in daylight.

"You're the one painting the invisible messages."

Not a question. She knows. Has known without knowing.

"Hale," he says. "And you're the girl who sees impossible things."

"Chloe."

"I know. Have been watching. Not—" He makes a gesture. "Not creepy watching. Curious watching. You see my work. No one else does."

"Your work?"

"UV paint. Special frequencies. Should be invisible unless—"

"Unless what?"

"Unless someone has eyes like yours."

She wants to ask what that means, but the storm pressure makes everything taste green-gold urgent, and there's something about the way he looks at her—not through her like everyone else, but at her, at what she actually is.

"Why?" she asks.

"Why paint invisible?"

"Yes."

He's quiet for a moment, organizing thoughts in what's clearly not his first language.

"In Sweden, we have word. *Ensamhet*. Means loneliness but more. Like—being only one who sees northern lights while everyone else sees empty sky."

"That's specific."

"That's my life. Until three months ago."

"What happened three months ago?"

"October third. I painted test on library wall. Message in UV. Next day, someone had arranged books to match the pattern. Exactly match. Impossible unless—"

"Unless they could see it."

"Yes. Was you, wasn't it?"

She remembers that day. Compulsive need to reorganize the study room books. Librarian yelled at her. But the arrangement felt necessary, like answering a question she didn't know had been asked.

"I didn't know why I did it."

"But you did it. You answered. We've been having conversation since. Me painting, you responding. Both thinking we're alone."

"But we're not."

"No. We're not."

Thunder rolls in the distance. Not close yet but coming. The air pressure makes her skin feel too tight.

"Storm will be bad," he says.

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"No. Will be worse than they think. I've been watching the water. The way it moves. Underground streams are already backing up. When rain comes—"

"Flooding."

"Catastrophic flooding. Starting from below."

"How do you know?"

"Maintenance. We see everything. All the systems. All the weak points." He pauses. "You should evacuate."

"Are you evacuating?"

"No."

"Then I'm not."

He almost smiles. "Stubborn."

"Practical. Where would I go?"

"Family?"

"Dead."

"Friends?"

"None who'd understand."

"Understand what?"

She gestures at the space between them where seventeen different temperatures create patterns only she can see.

"This. Whatever this is."

---

## Part 3: The Underground Gallery

4:30 PM. He shows her the basement.

Not the library basement—everyone knows about that. The maintenance tunnels beneath. Where pipes run and storage hides and UV paint covers every surface in messages no one else will ever see.

"How long have you been doing this?"

"Three years. Since I arrived. Scholarship for maintenance, but really I paint. Just... paint where no one looks."

"Why?"

"Why does anyone create? Because the images exist in my head and need to exist outside too. Because maybe someone, somewhere, has eyes to see. Because being invisible doesn't mean being nothing."

She runs her fingers along the wall. The paint has texture—raised in some places, smooth in others. Her fingers translate it to music, symphony in frequencies beyond hearing.

"This is beautiful."

"You can see it? Really see it?"

"Every color. Every layer. You painted this one first—" She points. "October maybe? Then added this November. This section is newest. Yesterday?"

"This morning. 4 AM."

"Why 4 AM?"

"Security shift change. Fifteen-minute window where no one watches."

"You've mapped their patterns."

"Have to. Wrong person sees me painting, asks questions. Visa is for maintenance, not art. They could send me back."

"To Sweden?"

"To nothing. Family doesn't— It's complicated."

She doesn't push. Understands complicated. Understands family that doesn't accept what you are.

"What does this say?" She points to Swedish words that pulse in seventeen different UV frequencies.

"*För någon som kanske känner.*"

"Which means?"

"For someone who might feel."

"Feel what?"

"The frequencies. The impossibility. The—" He struggles for words. "In Swedish, *Sväva*. To hover. Like northern lights. Between real and unreal."

"I know that feeling."

"I thought you might."

More thunder. Closer. The lights flicker—just for a second—but in that second, his UV paintings blaze brighter, like darkness makes them stronger.

"Power will fail," he says. "When storm hits fully. Emergency lighting runs on different spectrum. Will make everything visible."

"Everything?"

"Every message I've hidden. Every pattern. Every impossible thing."

"That sounds beautiful."

"Or terrifying. Depends who sees."

"Who would see? If people can't normally—"

"Some can. Partially. Under right conditions. Emergency lighting, thirty-seven degree angle, extreme stress—sometimes eyes do impossible things."

"Speaking from experience?"

"My mother. She could see... not everything. But enough. Enough to know I was different. Enough to be afraid."

"Afraid of what?"

"Colors that shouldn't exist. Patterns that suggest meaning where meaning shouldn't be. Her mind couldn't reconcile it. So she chose not to see me at all."

The weight of that sits between them. Chloe thinks of her own mother—different story, same ending. Parents who couldn't handle children who see too much.

---

## Part 4: The Storm Warning

5:45 PM. They're back at ground level. The library is emptying—evacuation officially starts at six.

"You really should go," Hale says.

"Already told you. I'm staying."

"Is dangerous."

"So is being alone with what I see."

He looks at her sharply. "What do you mean?"

"I mean—" How to explain? "My whole life, I see things others don't. Colors that shouldn't exist. Patterns that make no sense. Everyone thinks I'm crazy or traumatized or genetically broken. But you— you create the things I see. Which means either we're both crazy—"

"Or we're both something else."

"Yes."

"What do you think we are?"

"I think we're evidence that visible isn't everything. That reality has more frequencies than most people can perceive. That being different isn't being wrong."

He's quiet for a long moment. Then pulls out a UV marker.

"Give me your hand."

She extends it. He writes something on her palm. In normal light, nothing visible. But she sees it perfectly—seventeen different UV shades spelling out words:

*Du är inte ensam.*

"What does it mean?"

"You are not alone."

The words pulse with heat from his touch. Seventeen different temperatures that her brain translates to music, to color, to feeling she's never had before—being seen. Really seen.

"Where will you be? During the storm?"

"Working. Trying to protect the paintings. Some of them— I've been working on something. In Storke Tower. Highest point on campus."

"The carillon room?"

"Yes. If flooding comes, that's where I'll go. Safest place."

"Will I— will I see you again? After tonight?"

He looks at her hand, where UV words glow only for her eyes.

"If you want to."

"I want to."

"Then you will. When power fails, when emergency lights come on—look for my messages. They'll tell you where I am."

"Why not just tell me now?"

"Because—" He hesitates. "Because someone is looking for me. Someone who shouldn't find me. If they knew about you, about what you can see—"

"Who?"

"Doesn't matter. Just— be careful. Don't tell anyone about the paintings. About what you see."

"I never do."

"Good."

An announcement echoes through the building: "Library closing in fifteen minutes. All students must evacuate by 6 PM."

"I should go," she says.

"Where?"

"My dorm. Foster Hall."

"Third floor?"

"How did you—"

"I paint there sometimes. Outside your window. You arrange things on your windowsill that match my patterns."

"I do?"

"Every time. Like you're answering without knowing."

She thinks of all the times she's felt compelled to arrange objects, create patterns, respond to something she couldn't identify.

"We've been talking for months."

"Yes."

"Without knowing."

"Yes."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about this is impossible."

---

## Part 5: The Last Hour

6:00 PM. Library closed. Chloe walks back to her dorm through increasing wind. The rain hasn't started yet, but the air tastes like water—green-silver weight pressing down.

Emma intercepts her at the door.

"Thank god! I thought you'd left already."

"No, I'm staying."

"Are you insane? They're saying this could be the worst storm in decades."

"I'll be fine."

"Chloe—" Emma grabs her arm. "I know you're... different. See things different. But this is real danger."

"I know."

"Then why stay?"

Because someone else sees impossible things. Because the storm might make everything visible. Because for the first time in her life, she's not alone in her frequencies.

"I have my reasons."

Emma studies her. "Is it a guy?"

"What?"

"You have that look. That I-just-met-someone look."

"I don't have a look."

"You're literally glowing."

Chloe glances at her reflection in the window. Does look different—something in her peripheral vision, like she's resonating at new frequency. 

"It's nothing."

"Right. Nothing that has you staying during historic storm for no reason."

"Emma—"

"Fine. Keep your secrets. But at least come to the basement gathering. Safety in numbers."

"Maybe later."

Emma leaves, shaking her head. Chloe climbs to her room. Sits at her window. Arranges pencils on the sill without thinking—seventeen of them in pattern that mirrors something she can't see but feels.

Outside, the shimmer spreads. Not just the usual spots now—everywhere. Like the whole campus is shifting into different frequency. Like the storm is bringing visibility to invisible things.

Her phone buzzes. Alert from the National Weather Service:

CATASTROPHIC FLOODING EXPECTED. SEEK HIGHER GROUND. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

She looks at her palm. The UV message still glows:

*Du är inte ensam.*

You are not alone.

Thunder crashes directly overhead. The lights flicker—longer this time. For three seconds, darkness. Then emergency power kicks in.

And in that moment, she sees it—every UV message Hale has painted, suddenly visible in the emergency lighting spectrum. The entire campus covered in invisible art, all of it pulsing, calling, saying the same thing in hundred different ways:

*Find me.*

*Find me.*

*Find me.*

The rain begins.

---

## Part 6: The First Rising

7:30 PM. The rain isn't normal.

Not just volume—though it's already overwhelming the gutters, creating waterfalls where there should be drains. It's the quality. Dense. Aggressive. Like the sky is trying to return the ocean it borrowed.

Chloe stands at her window watching the campus transform. The shimmer she's been seeing for weeks intensifies with each lightning strike. In those brief, brilliant moments, she sees the UV messages clearly—trails of paint leading from building to building, all converging toward Storke Tower.

Her phone rings. Maria.

"Where are you?"

"My room."

"Are you insane? They're evacuating the dorms. Water's already coming up through the basement."

"From below?"

"Yeah, weird right? Pipes backing up or something. You need to get out."

"Where is everyone going?"

"Higher buildings. Campbell Hall, the Tower—anywhere above third floor."

The Tower. Where Hale said he'd be.

"I'll head there."

"Now, Chloe. This is serious."

"I know."

She doesn't pack much. Jacket, phone, charger. The pencils—she needs the pencils, though she doesn't know why. They feel important. Seventeen of them, wrapped in rubber band.

The hallway is chaos. Students running, crying, dragging belongings. The emergency lighting casts everything in harsh white-blue, but underneath—UV messages on every wall. Hale's been here. Recent. Maybe minutes ago.

One message stops her:

*Följ värmen.*

Follow the warmth.

She doesn't speak Swedish but understands anyway. Puts her hand on the wall. Feels the temperature variations—seventeen different warms leading like breadcrumbs toward the stairwell.

"Martinez! Move your ass!"

Brad, soaking wet, helping evacuate stragglers.

"I'm going."

"Where?"

"The Tower."

"Good. That's where we're sending everyone. Highest ground on campus."

He doesn't see the UV paint. Doesn't see how it pulses brighter when she touches it. Doesn't see that she's following a trail only she can perceive.

But he sees something. Pauses. Looks at her strangely.

"You okay? You look... different."

"Different how?"

"Like you're... glowing? No, that's stupid. Must be the emergency lights."

But she feels it too. Something changing. The storm, the pressure, the electromagnetic charge in the air—it's affecting her vision. Making her see more. Deeper. Frequencies she's never accessed before.

"I have to go," she says.

"Be careful. This is going to get worse."

He's right. She can see it in the shimmer—probability waves showing water rising, buildings flooding, disaster approaching in colors that taste like metal and fear.

But also—in the seventeenth color, the one that's always been uniquely hers—she sees possibility. Connection. Someone waiting in the Tower who paints in her frequencies.

---

## Part 7: The Trail of Seventeen Warms

8:00 PM. Outside is apocalypse.

Rain hits horizontal, driven by wind that sounds like screaming. The lagoon has overflowed, water spreading across paths, through gardens, into buildings. But it's not just from above—Brad was right. It's coming from below too. Storm drains reversing. Underground streams breaking free.

Chloe follows the UV trail. It leads not on the main paths but through maintenance routes, covered walkways, places where someone who knows the campus intimately would travel.

Every few yards, a message:

*Fortsätt.*  
(Continue)

*Nästan där.*  
(Almost there)

*Jag väntar.*  
(I'm waiting)

She doesn't know Swedish but knows these words. Feels them in frequencies beyond language.

The trail leads to Storke Tower's base. The door is locked—electronic systems failed. But there's UV paint around the handle, still wet, forming arrow pointing to maintenance panel. She opens it. Manual override lever, painted with seventeen different UV colors.

She pulls it. Door opens.

Inside, darkness except for emergency strips along the floor. But the UV paint blazes like road map—spirals up the stairwell, messages on every landing:

*First floor: Flooded soon*  
*Second floor: Not safe*  
*Third floor: Higher*  
*Fourth floor: Almost*  
*Fifth floor: Here*

She climbs. Behind her, she hears water entering the building—not rushing but seeping, inevitable, finding every crack.

Fourth floor. The carillon practice room. UV paint everywhere—not just messages but full gallery. Three years of work covering every surface in invisible art.

But no Hale.

Arrow pointing up. To the carillon itself. The bell tower.

She climbs the final ladder. Pushes through the trap door.

---

## Part 8: The Tower Gallery

The carillon room is transformed.

UV paint on every surface—walls, ceiling, even the bells themselves. In the emergency lighting, it all glows, but she sees deeper layers. Three years of messages, patterns, images. All for eyes that might never see.

And in the center, Hale. Painting.

"You came."

"You knew I would."

"Hoped. Not knew."

Lightning strikes—close, maybe hitting the building. In that brilliant moment, every UV frequency becomes visible even to normal eyes. The room explodes with color.

"My God," she breathes.

"Is too much?"

"It's perfect."

She walks the perimeter, reading three years of invisible messages:

*For someone who might exist*  
*For eyes that see impossible spectrums*  
*For connection beyond visible*

"You painted all this before you knew I existed."

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because—" He sets down his brush. "Because I had to believe someone, somewhere, could see. Otherwise, why have these abilities? Why see and create in frequencies others can't perceive?"

"Genetic accident. Evolution. Random mutation."

"Maybe. Or maybe we're meant to find each other. People who exist in same impossible frequencies."

Thunder crashes. The building shakes. Through the windows, she sees water rising—already at second floor of nearby buildings.

"We're going to be trapped," she says.

"Yes."

"For how long?"

"Until water goes down. Hours. Maybe days."

"You planned this."

"No. But I prepared for it. Look."

He shows her supplies—water, food, emergency blankets. Everything needed to wait out a flood.

"You knew it would be bad."

"I suspected. The underground water, the storm drains—I monitor them. Part of my job. They've been wrong for weeks."

"Wrong how?"

"Backing up. Like something blocking them. University ignored my reports."

"Why?"

"Because I'm just maintenance. Invisible. No one listens to invisible people."

She touches one of his paintings. Still wet. The seventeen warms of his handprint still present in the paint.

"I see you."

"I know."

"No, I mean—I really see you. Not just the paint. You. The seventeen different temperatures you radiate. The forty-three greens in your eyes. The way you exist in spectrums others can't perceive."

"How?"

"I don't know. Genetics. Mutation. Gift. Curse. All of it."

He moves closer. Close enough she can map his heat signature without trying. Close enough to see the UV paint under his skin—he's been painting himself, she realizes. Messages on his own body in frequencies only she can see.

"What does it say?" She points to his forearm where UV words glow through his shirt.

"Which one?"

"There's more than one?"

He rolls up his sleeves. His arms are covered in UV tattoos—not permanent but painted, repainted, layered. All in Swedish:

*Ensam* (Alone)  
*Söker* (Searching)  
*Hoppas* (Hoping)  
*Hittat* (Found)

The last one is newest. Still wet. Added today.

"Found," she translates without knowing how.

"Yes."

"Found what?"

"You."

Lightning strikes again. The room blazes with impossible light. In that moment, she sees everything—not just his paintings but the probability waves they create, the potential futures spreading from this moment, the frequencies of connection that shouldn't exist but do.

"This is insane," she says.

"Yes."

"We don't even know each other."

"No."

"You could be—anyone. Dangerous. Delusional."

"Yes."

"I could be imagining all of this. Trauma response to the storm."

"Maybe."

"But?"

"But you see my paintings. And I see you seeing them. We exist in same impossible space."

Wind howls. Water rises. The tower becomes island in growing flood.

And in the emergency lights, surrounded by three years of invisible art finally made visible, two people who see impossible colors stand at the beginning of eight hours that will change everything.

"What now?" she asks.

"Now we wait. And paint. And see what frequencies we can create together."

He hands her a UV marker.

She takes it.

Begins to draw.

The conversation that's been unconscious for three months becomes conscious. The connection that's been invisible becomes visible.

The storm rages.

The water rises.

But in the tower, in impossible light, two people speak in colors that don't have names.

*End of Chapter 2*

**[Word Count: 5,547]**# Following Invisible Trails
*September 18, 2024 - Morning Before Coffee Meeting*

---

## Part 1: The Basement Hum

The library basement hums at a frequency that tastes like copper pennies.

No one else hears it. Chloe knows because she's watched seventeen people walk past without reacting—students, librarians, that maintenance guy who isn't Hale but moves through the same spaces. They don't pause. Don't tilt their heads. Don't feel their teeth ache from the vibration.

But to her, the sound has color—pearl-violet with edges that shift green when she moves closer to the wall where yesterday she found him. Where twenty months ago water reached. Where now fresh UV paint blazes in frequencies that shouldn't exist.

"Still down here?"

Maria descends the stairs, coffee in each hand. One for her, one for Chloe—she knows the routine.

"He was here again," Chloe says.

"When?"

"This morning. Maybe an hour ago. The paint's still wet."

Maria squints at the wall. "I don't see—"

"You wouldn't. It's in—" She stops. Almost said *UV spectrum*. "It's in a frequency you can't see."

"Right. Your special vision thing." Maria doesn't say it mockingly. She's trying to understand. Has been trying for months. "What does it say?"

Chloe traces the invisible letters with her finger, translating: "*Följ färgerna till sanningen.*"

"Which means?"

"Follow the colors to the truth."

"Dramatic. Very Swedish art boy."

"It's not drama. It's—" How to explain? "He's leaving me a trail. To understand what we've been doing. The unconscious conversation."

"You mean your weird arranging thing and his invisible paintings?"

"They're not weird. They're—"

"I know, I know. Communication in frequencies I can't see. But Chloe—" Maria sits on the bottom step. "You're meeting him for coffee in what, three hours? Why all the cryptic trail stuff?"

"Because seeing is understanding. He wants me to see it all. Every painting. Every response. Twenty months of—"

"Of what?"

"Connection."

Maria studies her. That worried-friend look she's perfected.

"You don't really know him."

"I know his frequency."

"That's not the same as knowing someone."

"Isn't it?" Chloe photographs the wall with her phone. Through the screen: nothing. Through her eyes: a map. "When someone creates in exact patterns you create, when they respond to things you don't even know you're broadcasting, when you exist in the same impossible space—isn't that knowing?"

"It's something. I'm not sure it's knowing."

"Then what is it?"

"Maybe beautiful delusion. Maybe shared trauma from the flood. Maybe—"

"Maybe real."

"Yeah. Maybe that too."

---

## Part 2: The News Article

They sit on the basement floor, Chloe searching her phone while Maria pretends not to hover.

"What are you looking for?"

"Context. There's something—" She finds it. News article from last year. "Here. 'Gallery Owner's Son Cleared in Vandalism Case.'"

"So?"

"James Holbrook. Accused someone of stealing his UV painting technique."

"UV painting is a thing?"

"Apparently. But look—" She scrolls. "The accused was a Swedish exchange student. Maintenance worker. Name withheld."

"You think it was Hale?"

"Timeline fits. Says the accused had been painting 'invisible murals' on campus. That security couldn't find evidence because—"

"Because they're invisible."

"To most people."

Maria reads over her shoulder. "Says Holbrook claimed the other artist stole his technique, his style, his concept. But couldn't prove it because—"

"Because he couldn't see the actual paintings. Just knew someone else was doing UV work."

"This is insane."

"This is why Hale hides. Why he paints invisible. Someone tried to destroy him for creating art most people can't even see."

Her phone buzzes. Text from unknown number. Just coordinates: 34.413°N, 119.848°W.

"That's—" Maria starts.

"Humanities building. Third floor."

"How do you know the floor?"

"The third number. 848. Building number is 848. He's been teaching me his code."

"When?"

"Every painting. Every pattern. I just didn't know I was learning."

---

## Part 3: The Storage Room Gallery

The humanities building should be busy—morning classes, students everywhere. But the trail leads through maintenance corridors, unused stairwells, spaces between spaces where no one goes.

"This is creepy," Maria says, following.

"It's practical. He can't be seen. The Holbrook thing—"

"Was dropped. Says so in the article."

"Dropped doesn't mean forgotten. Dropped doesn't mean safe."

They reach a door marked "Storage." In UV spectrum, it blazes with text:

*För dig som ser*

"What's it say?" Maria asks.

"For you who sees."

"Just you? Or anyone who—"

"Just me. It's singular. Specific."

Chloe's hand trembles on the doorknob. Not fear. Recognition. The paint is still wet in UV spectrum—he was here recently. Maybe minutes ago. The seventeen different temperatures of his handprint still warm on the handle.

She opens the door.

"Holy shit," Maria breathes.

Even she can see something. Not the UV paintings—those blaze only for Chloe. But the sheer scale. Every surface covered. Three years of work.

"It's a gallery," Chloe whispers.

"It's an obsession."

"It's—" She steps inside, turns slowly. "It's responses. All of it. Responses to me."

"What?"

She points to the east wall. "October 2023. I arranged leaves by the campus fountain. Posted it on Instagram. This is the same pattern, but in UV."

"Coincidence."

"December 2023." She points to another section. "I sorted books by color frequency in the library. This is that exact gradient."

"How can you remember—"

"February 2024. I had an anxiety attack. Arranged sugar packets in the coffee shop to calm down. This—" She touches a painting that screams even in UV, chaos given color. "This is my panic translated to paint."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible."

Maria walks the perimeter, trying to see what Chloe sees. "There must be hundreds of paintings here."

"Four hundred ninety-seven."

"You counted?"

"Always counting. But also—" She points to tiny numbers in the corner of each piece. "He numbered them. Dated them. Creating a record."

"Of what?"

"Of unconscious conversation. Look—" She pulls out her phone, scrolls through her Instagram. "Every arrangement I posted has a painted response. Every pattern I created, he answered. We've been talking for twenty months without knowing."

"That's—"

"Insane? Beautiful? Impossible?"

"I was going to say romantic, but also terrifying."

"Why terrifying?"

"Because it means he's been watching you. Following your posts. Painting responses. For twenty months. Without you knowing."

"Without him knowing I could see them."

"What?"

"Think about it. He painted these before yesterday. Before we reunited. He was painting into the void, hoping someone, somewhere could see. Not knowing I existed."

"But targeting you specifically."

"No. Responding to patterns that appeared in places he could access. I was arranging things unconsciously. He was responding unconsciously. Neither of us knew the other existed but we were—"

"Having a conversation."

"Yes."

---

## Part 4: The Discovery

"Oh shit, someone's coming."

Footsteps in the hallway. Maria panics, but Chloe recognizes the rhythm—not Hale. Too heavy. Too careless.

The door opens. Marcus stands there, board shorts despite September, vape pen in hand.

"Martinez? What are you doing in my smoke spot?"

"Your what?"

"Found this place weeks ago. Perfect for—" He waves the vape pen. Then pauses. Looks around. "Wait, did someone clean it? It looks... different."

Chloe sees blazing gallery. Marcus sees empty room.

"Different how?" she asks carefully.

"I don't know. Cleaner? Emptier? Like someone painted over all the graffiti."

"There was graffiti?"

"Yeah, tons. Kids been tagging this place for years. But now—" He runs his hand along a wall covered in UV masterpieces. "Nothing. Weird."

He can't see any of it. The UV paint invisible to his normal eyes.

"Probably maintenance," Maria says quickly. "You know, cleaning up forgotten spaces."

"Since when does maintenance care about—" His phone buzzes. "Shit, late for philosophy. Don't narc about the vape, yeah?"

He leaves. They exhale simultaneously.

"He couldn't see any of it," Maria says.

"No one can. Except—"

"You."

"And partially Hale. He has some UV perception. Not complete, but enough."

"How do you know?"

"The paintings. Some parts are more detailed than others. The parts he can see fully versus the parts he's painting blind, on faith."

"Painting on faith." Maria shakes her head. "This whole thing is—"

"Look at this."

Fresh painting on the north wall. Still wet. Chloe can see the heat signature of his hands in the paint—seventeen different temperatures swirling through the pigment.

"What is it?"

"Me. Yesterday. The pencil arrangement I made while waiting."

"He saw you?"

"He was there. Watching me discover the library. Watching me understand. Then came here and painted it immediately."

Under the painting, Swedish and English intertwined:

*Kaffe klockan tre?*
*Coffee at three?*

"He's confirming your meeting."

"More than that. He's—" She checks the heat signatures around the room. "He's been here all morning. Setting this up. Creating context for our meeting. He wants me to understand what we've been doing before we talk about it."

"That's either really romantic or really manipulative."

"It's neither. It's—necessary. How else do you explain twenty months of unconscious communication? You have to see it to believe it."

---

## Part 5: The Trail Continues

"There's more."

Chloe follows the heat signatures—a trail of seventeen warms leading out of the room, down the hall, to another door.

"How are you tracking him?"

"Body heat lingers in UV spectrum. Different temperatures for different times. He was here—" She touches a doorframe. "Fifteen minutes ago."

"He's still in the building?"

"Maybe. Or maybe he's leading me somewhere."

The trail goes up. Fourth floor. Fifth. To a door marked "Roof Access - Authorized Personnel Only."

It's unlocked.

"We shouldn't—" Maria starts.

But Chloe's already climbing. The door opens onto the roof. Santa Barbara spread below, ocean gleaming, mountains behind. And on the ledge—

More UV paintings. But these are different. Equations. Formulas. Chemical compositions.

"What is all this?"

"Instructions," Chloe realizes. "He's teaching me how to make UV paint. The exact frequencies he uses. So I can—"

"Paint back?"

"Respond consciously instead of unconsciously."

Her phone buzzes. Unknown number. Photo attachment.

It's her. Taken from above. Right now. She looks up.

Across the quad, on the library roof, a figure. Too far to see details but she knows it's him. He holds something up—UV flashlight. Aims it at the humanities building.

The entire wall below them explodes with light. UV messages visible even from here, covering the whole side of the building. And in the center, huge, impossible to miss:

*I SEE YOU SEEING ME*

Then he's gone. But the message remains, blazing in frequencies only she can perceive.

---

## Part 6: The Coffee Shop Preparation

2:17 PM. The coffee shop on State Street.

"I can't believe we're forty-three minutes early," Maria says.

"I need to see what he's done."

"What do you mean?"

"The barista at the counter. Yesterday she mentioned he'd been here painting. Invisible painting."

They enter. The shop smells wrong—flood-changed—but familiar. The barista looks up, recognizes Chloe.

"You're early. Your boyfriend's not here yet."

"He's not my—When was he here?"

"All morning. Noon to like two. Sitting in that corner, doing his weird hand-waving thing."

"Hand-waving?"

"Yeah, like painting but with nothing there. We almost called someone but he kept buying tea and he seemed harmless. Just... intense."

"Did he say anything?"

"Asked about the light. How it changes through the day. When the sun hits that window at exactly thirty-seven degrees. Super specific. Is he like, autistic or something?"

"Or something," Chloe says.

She walks to the corner table. Sits. Surveys his invisible work.

The entire coffee shop is transformed. UV messages on every surface:

On the bathroom mirror: *Twenty months of searching*
Under the table: *Seventeen warms remembered*  
On the window: *Du ser mig / You see me*
On the ceiling: *För Chloe som ser det omöjliga* (For Chloe who sees the impossible)

"What do you see?" Maria asks.

"Evidence. Proof. He's documented everything. Every response to my patterns. Every unconscious communication. It's all here, invisible to everyone but me."

"Why?"

"Because—" She understands suddenly. "Because I need to know it's real. That I haven't imagined it. That twenty months of feeling connected to something invisible was actually connection."

"You thought you imagined it?"

"My therapist said I was creating patterns to cope with trauma. That the arrangements were symptoms. That seeing responses that weren't there was—"

"Delusion."

"Yeah."

"But it's not."

"No. It's real. He's real. This impossible thing between us is real."

---

## Part 7: The Final Message

2:43 PM. Seventeen minutes before their meeting.

"I should go," Maria says. "Give you space for your reunion or whatever this is."

"Stay. Please. I need—I need someone else to witness this. To know I'm not—"

"Crazy?"

"Alone."

Maria squeezes her hand. "You're not alone. Even if I can't see what you see."

Chloe's phone buzzes. Text: "Look up."

She does.

Across the street, on the building roof, Hale stands. Visible for exactly three seconds. He holds up a UV light—industrial strength, the kind that makes invisible things blaze.

He aims it at the coffee shop window.

The glass explodes with color. Not just messages—art. A portrait of her made from twenty months of patterns she created, transformed into impossible beauty only she can see.

Then he's gone. But the portrait remains.

"What happened?" Maria asks. "You're crying."

"Am I?"

She touches her face. Wet. She's crying from beauty, from recognition, from the overwhelming relief of being seen.

"He painted me. Not how I look but how I exist. My frequency. My pattern. The thing that makes me me in spectrums others can't perceive."

"That's—"

"Impossible. I know."

"I was going to say beautiful."

---

## Part 8: The Understanding

2:55 PM. Five minutes before the meeting.

Chloe sits at their table. The one he marked with UV paint. The one where seventeen warms will soon radiate from across the table.

"You okay?" Maria asks.

"I understand now. The trail. Why he led me through all of this before meeting."

"Why?"

"Because how do you explain twenty months of unconscious communication? How do you sit across from someone and say 'we've been talking without knowing'? You can't. You have to show it."

"And he showed you."

"Every painting. Every response. Every moment of connection we didn't know we were having."

"That's incredibly thoughtful or incredibly obsessive."

"Both. It's both. That's what we are—thoughtfully obsessive about frequencies others can't see."

Maria's phone buzzes. "Shit, I have class. Will you be okay?"

"Yes."

"Text me after. I want to know everything."

"You won't believe everything."

"Try me. I've gotten pretty good at believing impossible things since you came into my life."

She hugs Chloe, then leaves.

2:59 PM.

Chloe arranges seventeen sugar packets on the table. Not consciously. Her hands just know. They form a pattern that responds to all the UV paintings surrounding her. An answer to his invisible gallery. A confirmation that she sees, she understands, she's ready for whatever comes next.

3:00 PM.

The door opens.

He enters.

The seventeen warms arrive with him, radiating heat she can map without trying. He's painted new messages on his skin—she can see them through his clothes. Words in Swedish and English and something beyond language.

He sees the sugar packet arrangement. Smiles—the expression creates new colors in her peripheral vision.

"You followed the trail."

"You knew I would."

"Hoped. Not knew."

"The difference?"

"Hope requires faith. Knowing requires evidence."

"And now?"

"Now I have both."

He sits across from her. Exactly where his UV painting indicated. The seventeen warms settle into pattern she'll map forever—the specific heat signature of someone who creates in her frequencies.

"Hi," he says.

"Hi," she responds.

The conversation that's been unconscious for twenty months becomes conscious. The connection that's been invisible becomes visible. At least to them. At least for now.

That's enough.

That's everything.

**[Word Count: 5,623]**# When Emergency Lights Reveal
*January 9, 2023, 8:47 PM - Humanities Building, Second Floor*

---

## Part 1: The Death of Light

The lights die.

No flicker. No warning. No slow fade like in movies where people have time to gasp, to reach for each other, to prepare. Just sudden black so complete she tastes it—burnt copper and snow, the flavor of absolute darkness flooding her mouth like she's drowning in it.

"What the—" Someone's voice from down the hall. Male. Scared.

Then screaming. Not one voice but several, rising from the stairwell like smoke. And underneath the human sounds: water. Not the gentle lap of ocean on sand that she grew up with, not the musical trickle of fountains in the campus courtyards. This water sounds angry. Sounds hungry. Sounds like it's looking for something.

Looking for them.

Chloe's hands find the wall—cool plaster, slightly damp from the storm. She'd been walking toward the study room, following one of those UV trails she'd been seeing all week, the ones that shimmer at the edge of perception like heat mirages but in frequencies that taste purple. She'd finally decided to follow one to its source, staying late after her evening seminar, waiting for the building to empty so she could investigate without looking insane.

And now—

"Everyone stay calm!" A professor's voice from somewhere below. Professor Williams from the English department, she thinks. The one who always smells like pipe tobacco and disappointment. "Emergency lighting will—"

The emergency lighting kicks in.

But it's wrong. All wrong.

Not the usual harsh white fluorescents that make everyone look corpse-pale. These are different. UV-tinged. Battery-powered. Running on some backup system she's never seen activate before. The light comes in waves—purple-white-blue—cycling through wavelengths like a heartbeat.

And the world explodes.

---

## Part 2: The Invisible Gallery

The walls blaze with paint that shouldn't exist.

Not just one wall. Not just accents or touches. Every. Single. Surface.

Chloe's tetrachromatic eyes—the eyes that see a hundred million colors where others see three million—process the impossible gallery surrounding her. The UV paint reveals itself in layers, depths, dimensions that make her stomach flip with vertigo. It's like standing inside a living thing, inside someone's mind made visible.

Hooked letters crawl across the ceiling—Swedish, she thinks, those little crowns floating above vowels like halos on angels. But wrong. Twisted. Like someone wrote them underwater, or dying, or both. The words pulse with their own light, shifting between frequencies her brain translates into sensation:

*Jag målar för någon jag aldrig träffat*
(I paint for someone I've never met)

The midnight-blue floods her mouth with salt, the taste of tears she hasn't cried yet. Arctic-silver numbs her tongue like she's been eating ice, like she's been kissing winter. Poison-yellow—no, not poison, something else, something that makes her gag with its intensity—cadmium yellow-green at exactly 545 nanometers, her brain supplies, the frequency of nausea and ecstasy combined.

"What the hell—"

She stumbles backward, her hand searching for something solid, something real. Her spine hits the wall and—

It's wet.

Not water-wet. Paint-wet. Fresh.

She pulls her hand away and in the UV light she can see it: her palm glowing with transferred pigment, patterns that weren't there seconds ago now mapped across her skin like temporary tattoos, like promises, like proof.

The paint is still wet. Someone was here. Recently. Maybe minutes ago. Maybe—

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

---

## Part 3: The Ghost Becomes Real

In the doorway: a silhouette.

Tall—maybe six-two, her brain catalogues automatically, the way it categorizes colors and frequencies and the seventeen different temperatures she's been feeling all week in places he's touched. Narrow shoulders, long arms, hands that hang at his sides like they're not quite sure what to do when they're not holding a brush.

He's holding something that glows. A UV pen, she realizes. Still uncapped. Still dripping.

"You see them."

Not a question. That accent—Swedish, careful, like he's testing if words still work after months of silence. The consonants sharper than American English, the vowels rounder, fuller. The maintenance ghost. Real. Here. Standing in the doorway watching her see his invisible gallery with something like wonder, something like relief, something like recognition.

"The paintings," she manages, her voice cracking. "They're—everywhere. Every wall. How long—"

"Three years." He steps forward and the emergency light catches his face properly for the first time.

Sharp bones, like someone carved him from pale wood and forgot to sand down the edges. Eyes that reflect frequencies that shouldn't exist—green, but not just green. Forty-three different greens if she counts them all, which she does, automatically, the way she counts everything. Forest-green-217 at the centers fading to sea-foam-98 at the edges with rings of jade-silver-mercury where normal people would just see "hazel."

"Three years?" Her voice sounds strange, like it's coming from someone else. "You've been painting these for three years?"

"Started small. Just one wall in the basement. Testing if anyone would notice." He sets down the UV pen on the window ledge, his hand shaking slightly. She notices his fingers—long, stained with chemicals that glow faintly under the emergency lights. "No one did. So I painted more. And more. Until—"

"Until what?"

"Until October. When someone finally responded."

---

## Part 4: The Test

"How many colors?" His voice cracks on 'colors,' like it's a word he's been wanting to say to someone specific for a very long time.

She doesn't have to think about it. Her brain has already catalogued them, filed them away in the strange mental system she's developed over twenty years of seeing things others can't.

"In that spiral there?" She points to a pattern near the door. "Fifty-three distinct shades. No—fifty-four. They keep shifting. Like they're breathing."

His intake of breath is sharp, sudden. Like she's punched him. Like she's saved him.

"Most people see one. Maybe two if the light's right and they're really looking."

"I'm not most people."

"No," he agrees, and there's something in his voice that makes her skin prickle with recognition. "You're not. You have four types of color cones instead of three. You're tetrachromatic."

Four cones. The words hang in the air between them like UV paint, invisible to everyone but them.

"How do you know that?" Her voice is whisper-thin. "How could you possibly know that?"

"Because I researched it. After—" He stops, looks at the walls covered in months, years of work. "After I realized you were responding."

"Responding?"

He pulls out his phone, swipes to photos. "Look."

The first image: a pattern painted on the library basement wall. A spiral of colors that starts with pure UV white and shifts through spectrums she doesn't have names for.

The second image: a photograph someone posted on Instagram. Her Instagram. October 15th. Her pencils arranged on a study desk in the exact same spiral pattern, unconsciously echoing something she'd never consciously seen.

"That's—that's mine."

"I know." He swipes again. "And this."

November 3rd. A painting on the third-floor hallway—interlocking circles in seventeen different UV shades.

Next photo: Her coffee cups from the campus café, arranged and photographed, posted with the caption "when your brain won't stop making patterns." The same seventeen circles, the same mathematical relationships between them.

"I started painting responses," he says, swiping through more photos. Each UV painting followed by one of her unconscious arrangements. "You'd create a pattern, I'd see it and paint it in UV the next night. Then you'd respond to mine without knowing it. We've been having a conversation, Chloe."

Her name. He knows her name.

"How—"

"Instagram handle. @ChloeMartinezArt."

Of course.

A student runs past the doorway, flashlight swinging wildly. The beam illuminates the walls—

Nothing. Just beige paint. Institutional. Bland. Normal.

The student doesn't slow, doesn't gasp, doesn't see the miracle surrounding them.

But when the emergency light cycles back through its UV wavelength, the paintings blaze back to life.

Only for her.

"Does anyone else—can anyone else see—"

He shakes his head. "I've tested it. Brought other people here with UV lights. Showed them photos." He shows her his phone again, swipes to the camera app, holds it up to the wall.

Through the screen: blank beige walls.

Through her eyes: a gallery of impossible beauty.

"The cameras can't capture it," he says. "The frequency is too specific. And human eyes—normal human eyes—they don't have the receptors."

"Just me?"

"Just you." He pauses, and she can see him struggling with something, deciding whether to say it. "I painted them for you. Only for you. I didn't know who you were at first, but I knew you were seeing them. Responding. The only person who could."

---

## Part 5: The Recognition

The patterns. Oh god, the patterns.

Now that he's pointed it out, she can see it everywhere. That spiral in the corner—it matches her pencil arrangement from October, yes, but it's more than that. It's been evolving. Each time she created a new pattern, he responded with a variation. Each time he painted something new, she unconsciously echoed it in her daily life.

"That burst there—" She points to an explosion of gold-silver-pearl near the window.

"Your Instagram from November 20th. The way you arranged the leaves you collected."

"And that grid pattern—"

"December 1st. Your advent calendar but in frequencies only you could see."

She turns in a slow circle, taking it all in. Three years of work. Hundreds of paintings. Thousands of hours. All invisible to everyone but her.

"Why?" she asks. "Why spend three years painting things no one could see?"

"Because someone could see them. You could. I knew you were out there, somewhere. I could feel it. Like—" He struggles for words, his accent thickening. "In Sweden, we have stories about the Huldra. Forest spirits only certain people can perceive. They leave signs, patterns, trails of light. But only for the ones meant to see them."

"And you thought I was meant to see these?"

"I hoped. And then you proved it. Every pattern you made, every response—you were seeing them. We were talking without words, without meeting, without even knowing each other existed."

The building shudders.

Not earthquake. Something worse.

Water.

Through the window, she can see it. The lagoon has breached its banks. The water isn't just rising—it's racing, searching, hungry. Already at the building's entrance. Already inside.

"We need to go." His voice shifts from wonder to urgency. "Now."

---

## Part 6: The Touch

He grabs her hand.

The contact is electric but not—it's more than that, stranger than that. Seventeen different temperatures register simultaneously where his skin meets hers, her synesthesia exploding into combinations that shouldn't exist:

- Thumb: 98.7°F translating to amber-gold-honey
- Index finger: 97.9°F reading as coral-pink-dawn  
- Middle finger: 98.1°F processing as silver-blue-moon
- Ring finger: 96.8°F becoming forest-green-deep
- Pinkie: 97.2°F shifting to violet-purple-dusk
- Palm center: 99.1°F blazing orange-red-sun
- Wrist pulse: 98.6°F exact, pure white-light-center

And ten more points across his hand, each with its own temperature, its own color, its own frequency that her impossible brain translates into meaning.

Seventeen warms. 

She's felt them before—in library books he's touched, their pages carrying his heat signature for hours after. Bench arms where he's rested, the wood retaining his specific thermal pattern. Walls he's painted, the oils from his skin mixing with the UV pigments to create a signature only her tetrachromatic nervous system can detect.

"You're real," she says, stupid with recognition. All these weeks of feeling haunted, of sensing someone just out of sight, of following trails that led nowhere—he was real. Is real. Is here.

"So are you." His grip tightens, and three of the seventeen temperatures spike. "You're the ghost I've been painting for."

They start running.

---

## Part 7: The Revelation in Motion

The hallway stretches before them, lit by emergency strobes that cycle through UV wavelengths. With each flash, more paintings reveal themselves—not random, she realizes, but a mapped journey. He's been creating a path.

"Did you plan this?" she gasps as they run.

"Plan what?"

"The paintings—they're leading somewhere."

"To the tower. Always to the tower. Highest point on campus."

They pass a cluster of students heading the wrong way. "Not that way!" Hale shouts. "Water's coming from there!"

"How do you know?" someone yells back.

"I work maintenance. I know where the lowest points are. Follow us!"

Some do. Some don't.

They keep running, and with each section of hallway, Chloe reads more of their unconscious conversation painted on the walls:

*October 15:* His first response to her pattern—tentative, questioning.  
*October 22:* Her unconscious reply—more complex, adding elements.  
*October 29:* His excitement visible in the paint strokes—larger, bolder.  
*November 5:* Her patterns becoming deliberate, even if she didn't know why.  
*November 12:* His confession in Swedish: *Jag tror jag älskar någon jag aldrig träffat* (I think I love someone I've never met).  
*November 19:* Her response in pure pattern—a heart shape she doesn't remember making.

"The walls," she breathes, not from exertion but from understanding. "They're a diary. Our diary."

"Three years of one-sided conversation," he says, pulling her around a corner. "Until two months ago when you started answering."

They pass more students fleeing. 

"The walls!" Chloe shouts, needing someone else to see, to witness, to confirm she's not losing her mind. "Look at the walls!"

No one looks. Or they look and see nothing. Their eyes slide past miracles, focused only on escape. One girl even runs her hand along the wall for balance, her palm passing right through a UV masterpiece, and feels nothing but institutional beige.

She's alone in this vision.

No—

"I painted them for you," Hale says, pulling her up the stairwell. The UV paintings here are different—more urgent, more recent. Some still wet like the one she touched. "Only for you. I didn't know who you were, but I knew you were seeing them. Responding. The only person who could."

---

## Part 8: The Science of Seeing

As they climb, he explains in breathless bursts:

"Tetrachromacy—genetic mutation—X-chromosome linked—"

"My mother," Chloe gasps, understanding flooding through her. "She used to say she saw colors that didn't exist. They medicated her for it."

"Not madness—evolution—fourth cone—between red and green—hundred million colors—"

"Instead of three million—I know—I counted them once—took me a week—"

They reach the third floor. Water sounds below. Closer. Angrier.

"How did you know to paint in UV?"

"I didn't—at first—just liked how it looked—under blacklight in my room—then I researched—found papers—about tetrachromats—some can see into UV spectrum—"

"Dr. Jameson's paper—Newcastle University—I read it too—"

"You researched yourself?"

"Wouldn't you?" She laughs, but it's edged with hysteria. "If you saw impossible things?"

Fourth floor. The paintings here are all from this week. Fresh. Desperate. Like he knew something was coming.

"This week's paintings," she pants. "They're different."

"I knew—felt it—something changing—had to paint faster—more—"

"The storm—"

"Not just the storm—you were coming closer—following the trails—I could feel it—"

Fifth floor. Almost there.

"Wait." She stops, has to know. "My patterns—could you always see them?"

"No." He turns to face her, and in the strobing UV light, his eyes cycle through all forty-three greens. "But I felt them. Like pressure changes. Like someone calling my name in a frequency I couldn't quite hear. So I painted toward the feeling."

"And I arranged toward yours."

"We were finding each other." His accent is thick now, emotion and exertion stripping away his careful English. "Through impossible colors. Through invisible art."

The building shakes. Water has reached the second floor.

"Come on!"

---

## Part 9: The Cathedral of Light

They burst through the door to the final stairwell, the one that leads to the tower room, and Chloe stops so suddenly that the students behind them crash into her back.

"Holy—"

It's a cathedral.

No—it's more than that.

Every surface—walls, ceiling, pipes, handrails, even the underside of the stairs above them—is covered in UV paintings. But these aren't like the ones below. These are synchronized. Orchestrated. They tell a story.

"When did you—"

"Every night for three years. This was my real canvas. The other halls were just... breadcrumbs. Leading here."

She turns in a slow circle, reading the story in light:

Panel 1: A figure alone, painting in darkness.  
Panel 2: Shadows watching, always just out of sight.  
Panel 3: Patterns appearing—small at first, then growing.  
Panel 4: Two sets of patterns, dancing around each other.  
Panel 5: Recognition—two figures finally seeing each other.  
Panel 6: Water rising, but the figures are together.

"You painted our future," she whispers.

"I painted my hope."

The water crashes below. Third floor now. Rising faster.

"There!" He points to a door marked "Authorized Personnel Only." His maintenance keys shake as he unlocks it. "Carillon room. Highest point."

As they climb the final narrow staircase, Chloe turns for one last look at the cathedral of invisible art. Every surface is covered in frequencies only she can see, their unconscious conversation made manifest in UV and wonder.

But more than that—she can see the evolution. The paintings from three years ago are tentative, questioning. The ones from last year are bolder, more confident. And the ones from the last two months—since she started responding—they're explosions of joy, of recognition, of connection.

They're love letters in light.

---

## Part 10: The Promise

"After this," she says as he opens the door to the tower room. The space is small, cramped, filled with the mechanical workings of the carillon bells. But it's dry. High. Safe for now. "After we don't die. Will I still see them?"

He turns to her, and she can see he's been crying. The tears leave trails in the UV paint dust on his face, creating new patterns, new art.

"Only if you know where to look." He pulls something from his pocket—a small UV flashlight, the kind used for checking counterfeit bills, but modified somehow, the wavelength adjusted to exactly 365 nanometers. "Or if you have this."

She takes it. Their fingers touch again—seventeen warms, always seventeen, her personal proof that he's real—and her synesthesia translates his touch into colors that taste like safety in a drowning world:

- Safety tastes like amber-gold-honey
- Trust tastes like coral-pink-dawn
- Recognition tastes like silver-blue-moon
- Desire tastes like forest-green-deep
- Fear tastes like violet-purple-dusk
- Love tastes like orange-red-sun
- And hope—hope tastes like pure white-light-center

"What's your name?" she realizes she doesn't know. "Your real name?"

"Hale. Hale Lindqvist."

"Hale," she repeats, and his name tastes like winter mornings, like UV light, like art that only exists for her. "I'm Chloe Martinez."

"I know," he says, and smiles for the first time. "I've been painting your name on walls for two months."

They can hear others reaching the door—other students who followed them, who trusted the maintenance ghost and the girl who sees impossible colors. They'll squeeze maybe fifteen people into this tiny room. They'll spend eight hours pressed close, sharing air, sharing warmth, sharing the knowledge that they might die.

But right now, in this moment before the others arrive, it's just them.

"Show me," Chloe says, clicking on the UV flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness, and yes—there on the wall, painted in pigments that shouldn't exist:

*Chloe Martinez kan se mig*  
(Chloe Martinez can see me)

*Jag målar för Chloe Martinez*  
(I paint for Chloe Martinez)

*Chloe Martinez, du är inte ensam*  
(Chloe Martinez, you are not alone)

Her name, over and over, in frequencies only she can perceive. A prayer. A promise. A proof that someone else knows what it's like to see the world differently.

"I see you," she says.

"And I see you seeing," he replies.

The door bursts open. Students flood in. The room fills with bodies, with panic, with the sounds of rising water.

But Chloe and Hale stand by the small window, watching the flood transform their campus into an ocean, and she thinks: 

*We've already been drowning. In isolation. In impossible perception. In colors without names.*

*Maybe this flood isn't ending something.*

*Maybe it's beginning.*

She clicks off the UV light to save the battery. They'll need it later, during the eight hours of darkness ahead, to read the rest of their conversation painted on these walls. To understand how two strangers fell in love through invisible art. To prove that connection doesn't require meeting—sometimes it just requires seeing and being seen.

The water rises.

The conversation continues.

And somewhere in the darkness, new patterns begin to form—not in paint this time, but in the space between two people who speak in frequencies the rest of the world will never understand.

## Part 1: The Amplified Perception

Her apartment walls pulse with colors that don't exist.

Not hallucination. Not imagination. The coffee meeting—touching him, confirming seventeen warms, tasting their connection—amplified everything beyond previous limits. Like her four cones got upgraded to five, six, seventeen. Like touching him rewired her neural pathways to perceive frequencies that physics hasn't discovered.

She sits at her kitchen table, watching reality shimmer. Northwest corner: pearl-silver-violet spreading like slow lightning. East wall: copper-green waves that taste like electricity. Ceiling: gold fractals that shouldn't be visible but blazed into existence the moment she got home.

The phone sits in front of her. His number glowing in screen-light that fractures into forty-three different blues—each one a different emotional temperature. She's been staring at it for seventeen minutes. Always seventeen when it comes to him.

Call? Text? Wait?

Her hands move without permission, arranging items on the table—salt shaker, pepper mill, sugar bowl, her coffee mug from this afternoon that still smells like him somehow. The arrangement creates its own color: purple-gold static that tastes like the moment before lightning strikes.

"Jesus, Chloe, you okay?"

Emma, her roommate. Standing in the doorway with concern painting her face orange-pink (worry-color, friend-color, the color of normal people caring about abnormal people).

"Fine."

"You've been sitting there for twenty minutes just... staring."

"Seventeen minutes."

"What?"

"Seventeen. Not twenty."

Emma comes closer. "Are you high? Did coffee-date guy drug you?"

"No. Maybe. Not with drugs."

"That's not reassuring."

"I'm fine. Just... seeing things differently."

"Your tetrachromacy thing?"

Emma knows the basics. That Chloe sees more colors. Safe version. Not the full truth about UV messages and impossible frequencies and someone who paints in her exact wavelengths.

"Yeah. But more. After today it's—"

The phone rings.

His number.

The ringtone creates cascading colors that shouldn't exist—sound becoming light becoming taste becoming—

"You going to answer that?" Emma asks.

Chloe answers.

---

## Part 2: The Voice That Paints

"Hale?"

"You see them now. The colors. In your apartment."

Not a question. Statement. He knows.

His voice through the phone creates synesthetic cascade her brain can barely process:
- Swedish accent = silver-blue frequency at 467.3 nanometers
- Exhaustion = purple underscore at 380 nanometers  
- Hope = gold overtone at 570 nanometers
- Seventeen different emotional temperatures she can somehow hear
- All of it combining into sound-color that makes her teeth ache with beauty

"How do you know?"

"Because same happened to me. After tower. After touching you. Your frequency everywhere. Leaked into universe. Stained everything."

"For twenty months?"

"Twenty months. Got stronger after yesterday. After reunion. After confirming you're real."

Emma mimes "I'll give you privacy" and heads to her room, but not before mouthing "Hot Swedish guy?" with exaggerated eyebrow waggle.

Chloe nods, though "hot" doesn't begin to describe someone whose voice creates colors that shouldn't exist.

"Describe what you're seeing," he says. "Right now. Your walls."

She looks. Really looks with whatever her perception has become.

"Northwest corner. Pearl-silver-violet spreading like... like slow lightning? No, like... like water moving upward. Defying gravity. Frequency about 478 nanometers but shifted into UV. Tastes like mint and copper and—" She stops. "This sounds insane."

"Keep going."

"East wall. Copper-green waves. Not moving but implying movement. Like... kinetic potential frozen in color."

"What temperature?"

"The color?"

"Yes."

She doesn't question how color has temperature. With him, everything has everything.

"Ninety-three point seven degrees."

"Fahrenheit?"

"Celsius."

"That's impossible. Would be visible heat."

"Everything about us is impossible."

"Yes." His voice does something—shifts frequency, creates new color through the phone. "But real."

---

## Part 3: The Unconscious Conversation

"You're arranging something," he says suddenly. "While we talk."

She looks down. Her free hand has been organizing paper clips from the jar. Spiral pattern. Seventeen clips in perfect mathematical progression. She didn't notice doing it.

"How did you—?"

"Because I'm painting. Same spiral. Right now. Without meaning to."

"What?"

"My hand. Is moving. Creating spiral. Seventeen loops. Same pattern you're making."

"That's—"

"Impossible. I know. But look at your paper clips."

She does. The spiral follows golden ratio. Fibonacci sequence. But more—in UV spectrum visible only to her, the clips create pattern that pulls at her chest like gravity.

"We're still having the conversation," she says.

"Twenty months of conversation. Even separated."

"Even now. On phone."

"Especially now. Distance doesn't stop it. Just changes frequency."

She adds another paper clip. Feels him add another paint stroke three miles away. Their hands moving in synchronization despite separation.

"This is terrifying," she says.

"Yes."

"And beautiful."

"Yes."

"And I don't want it to stop."

"No. Me neither."

---

## Part 4: The Scars Story

"Tell me about the scars," she says. "The ones painted with UV."

Long pause. His breathing creates colors through the phone—inhale is blue-silver at 440 Hz, exhale is gold-green at 528 Hz. She could paint his respiratory pattern if she knew how to paint.

"Month six. June. When searching failed. When I accepted you were gone."

"But you kept painting."

"Differently. On myself. Where only you could see if you existed."

"Why scars underneath?"

Another pause. She hears him set down his brush—the tiny click creates purple splash in her vision.

"Needed to mark it. The losing. The absence. Scars for grief. But then—"

"What?"

"Realized scars alone were just pain. Needed to transform them. Make them mean something else. So painted over them. UV messages. For you. If you ever found me. Evidence of waiting."

"Seventeen scars."

"You counted. At coffee."

"I count everything. Especially you."

His laugh looks golden through the phone. Not metaphor—literal synesthetic translation. Golden with edges of silver-sad at 470.5 nanometers.

"What number am I now?" he asks.

She's already calculating. Adding every temperature, every frequency, every impossible color he creates:

"Still infinite. But more infinite than this morning."

"Infinity can't increase."

"Ours can. Gets more infinite every time we talk. Every pattern we create. Every impossible thing we prove real."

"Sustainable infinity?"

"Daily infinity. Tuesday infinity. Regular life infinity."

"I like that better than emergency infinity."

"Me too."

---

## Part 5: The Tower Memory Test

"Tell me something only we would know," she says. "From that night. Prove this is real."

"The kiss tasted like ending but looked like beginning."

"Anyone could guess that."

"No. You said specific words. After. When water stopped rising. You said: 'The kiss tastes like copper-mint-snow and looks like geometry that shouldn't exist.'"

Her breath catches. Those exact words. Her synesthetic description that made no sense but perfect sense.

"What else?"

"You counted. While we waited for rescue. Ninety-three. Over and over."

"Ninety-three what?"

"Different shades of black in darkness. You said darkness has colors too. That I looked like 'light that gave up being bright but found new way to shine.'"

Every word correct. Every impossible description. He memorized her tetrachromatic perceptions perfectly.

"You really remember."

"Everything. Every color you described. Every pattern you saw. Every impossible thing you said. Memorized like prayer. Like map. Like promise I'd find you."

"But you didn't find me. I found you."

"We found each other. Through art. Through frequencies. Through impossible made visible."

"That's very Swedish of you."

"What?"

"Making it mutual. Egalitarian. No hero narrative."

"You want hero narrative?"

"No. Want true narrative. We saved each other. Are still saving each other."

"From what?"

"From being only ones who see impossible things."

---

## Part 6: Emma's Interruption

Emma's door opens. She peeks out, sees Chloe still on phone.

"Sorry," she whispers. "But the kitchen is doing something weird."

"What?"

"The spices. They're... arranged? Did you do that?"

Chloe looks. The entire spice rack reorganized by color frequency. Twenty-three jars in perfect gradient from white pepper to black cardamom. Her unconscious response to whatever Hale's painting.

"I'll call you back," she tells Hale.

"No, stay on. Want to hear this."

Emma approaches the spice rack. "This is like... art? But also math? The progression is perfect."

"It's how I think," Chloe says.

"While on the phone? Unconsciously?"

"Apparently."

"That's..."

"Weird. I know."

"I was going to say impressive. Can you do my closet next?"

Chloe laughs. The sound has color—surprised-gold with relief-silver edges.

"Who's that?" Hale asks through phone.

"Roommate. Emma."

"She sees the patterns?"

"The obvious ones. Not the frequencies. Not the real arrangement."

"There's more?"

"There's always more. Seventeen layers minimum."

Emma shakes her head. "You're talking to him about the arrangement? While making the arrangement?"

"It's complicated."

"Apparently." Emma grabs crackers from the counter. "I'll leave you to your... whatever this is. Tetrachromatic phone sex?"

"Emma!"

"What? The way you're looking at that spice rack is definitely intimate."

She leaves. Chloe's face burns—embarrassment creating its own heat signature she can actually see in peripheral vision. Pink-red at exactly 98.7 degrees.

"She sounds fun," Hale says.

"She doesn't understand but tries."

"That's all we can ask from people."

"Is it enough?"

"Has to be. Unless we want to only talk to each other forever."

"That doesn't sound terrible."

"No. But limiting. We have things to show world."

---

## Part 7: The Plan

"Tomorrow," he says. "Library. Where we met yesterday."

"Why?"

"Want to show you something. All the paintings. From twenty months. Have them stored. Documented. Our entire unconscious conversation."

"All of them?"

"Four hundred ninety-seven paintings. Photographed. Dated. Matched to your Instagram posts."

"You matched them?"

"Last night. After coffee. Couldn't sleep. Needed to prove to myself the pattern was real."

"And?"

"Perfect correlation. Every arrangement you posted, I responded to within hours. Without knowing. We were having conversation across city, across time, across impossibility."

"Why show me?"

"Because—" His voice shifts, creates new color through phone. Color she's never seen before. Amber-gold-silver with UV edges. Color that might be love if love existed in visible spectrum. "Because we can make something. Together. That no one else can make."

"Art?"

"More. Language. For colors without names. For connections that shouldn't exist. For love that paints itself in frequencies."

She sees it suddenly—not imagination but actual perception of probability:
- Gallery of impossible art only they can fully see
- Others with tetrachromacy finding them, knowing they're not alone
- Language expanding to hold new colors
- Love becoming visible through art
- Future painted in frequencies science hasn't discovered

"Ten AM?" she asks.

"Ten. And Chloe?"

"Yeah?"

"Wear something with color. Real color. Want to see how many you contain."

"How many do you think?"

"Infinite. But counting will be fun."

"You want to count my colors?"

"Want to map them. Memorize them. Paint them. Make them visible to everyone."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible. Hasn't stopped us yet."

---

## Part 8: The Night Colors

They hang up eventually. Have to. She needs to sleep. He needs to paint. Life needs to continue beyond phone calls that create new colors.

But her apartment has transformed. Not just his colors now—theirs. The combination creating something beyond either alone. The walls pulse with shared frequency that tastes like future.

Emma returns, stops in doorway.

"Okay, what the hell?"

"What?"

"You're glowing."

"I'm not—"

"Not literally. But like... your whole apartment looks different. Brighter? More colorful? Did you change the lights?"

"No."

"Then what?"

"I talked to someone who sees what I see."

"Another tetrachromat?"

"No. He sees different impossibilities. But they match mine."

"That makes no sense."

"Nothing about us makes sense. But it's real."

Emma walks through the apartment, examining. "You arranged everything. While on the phone. Not just spices. Everything."

Chloe looks. She's right. Books reorganized by color frequency. Dishes stacked in spectrum order. Even the furniture subtly shifted to create better angles for light.

"It's how we talk," she says.

"Through furniture arrangement?"

"Through everything. Colors. Patterns. Art. Frequencies that shouldn't exist."

"Sounds complicated."

"It's the simplest thing in the world."

And it is. Despite impossible colors. Despite twenty months apart. Despite speaking in spectrums.

Simple:
- Two people seeing each other in dimensions others can't perceive
- Two people creating language for impossible things  
- Two people proving love exists in frequencies science hasn't named

---

## Part 9: The Text Conversation

Her phone buzzes. Text from him.

"Your apartment walls still pulsing?"

"Stronger now. Like they're breathing."

"What color?"

She looks. Tries to describe. "Color that doesn't exist yet. Like... if hope and physics had a baby."

"That would be us."

"What?"

"Hope and physics creating impossible baby."

"That's terrible metaphor."

"English isn't first language."

"Your English is perfect."

"Not when trying to describe you. No language is sufficient for your frequencies."

She's about to respond when another text arrives. A photo. His studio. Every surface covered in paintings—UV and visible light combined. All of them attempting to capture something.

"Is that—"

"You. All you. Twenty months of painting you without knowing."

She enlarges the photo. Even through phone screen, even without full UV visibility, she can see it. The same frequency she broadcasts. The same impossible colors she contains.

"How?"

"Don't know. Just knew what colors felt right. What patterns needed to exist. Painted them. Now I know they were all you."

"That's—"

"Impossible. Insane. Beautiful. True. All of it."

"Yes."

Another photo. Close-up of one painting. Today's date. Her coffee cup arrangement from this afternoon transformed into art that makes her chest ache.

"When did you paint this?"

"While we talked. Couldn't stop hand from moving."

"We're still doing it. The unconscious conversation."

"Not unconscious anymore. Just conversation in language we're inventing."

"What language?"

"Color. Frequency. Pattern. Touch. Everything beyond words."

She photographs her arranged apartment. Sends it. 

"Beautiful," he texts immediately. "See you in everything."

"Is that good or terrifying?"

"Both. Best things always are."

---

## Part 10: Sleep in Impossible Colors

She should sleep. It's past midnight. Tomorrow (today now) she meets him at library. Sees twenty months of invisible conversation. Begins making impossible art together.

But sleep feels wrong when her apartment pulses with new frequencies. When her phone contains his voice transformed to color. When tomorrow holds possibility of making invisible visible.

Emma stumbles out for water. Sees Chloe still awake.

"You need to sleep."

"Can't. Too much color."

"That's not a thing."

"It is for me."

Emma sits beside her. Friend-warmth radiating at exactly 98.6 degrees normal human temperature. Comforting in its simplicity.

"Is this going to be your new normal? Arranging everything and seeing impossible things?"

"Maybe."

"And hot Swedish guy?"

"Hale. His name is Hale."

"And Hale is part of new normal?"

"Hale IS the new normal. Or makes normal impossible. Or makes impossible normal."

"You really like him."

"I really see him. And he sees me. In frequencies nobody else can perceive."

"That's either most romantic thing ever or sign you both need therapy."

"We're both in therapy. Therapists think we're trauma-bonding."

"Are you?"

"Maybe. But also more. Also real. Also sustainable. Also daily. Also forever."

Emma hugs her. The contact creates brief color-burst—friendship rendered visible in pink-gold pulse.

"I'm happy for you. Even if I don't understand any of it."

"Thanks."

"Now sleep. You need to be rested for tomorrow's impossible art date."

Chloe goes to bed. Lies in darkness that isn't dark—seventeen shades of black each pulsing with different frequency. Closes her eyes. Still sees colors. His colors. Their colors. Tomorrow's colors waiting to be born.

Her phone buzzes once more.

"Sleep in impossible colors, Chloe. Dream in frequencies we'll make real."

She does.

Dreams of galleries where UV light makes love visible. Of language expanded to hold their connection. Of two people who shouldn't exist but do, creating art from the impossible space between them.

Tomorrow they begin.

Tonight she sleeps surrounded by proof that some things transcend distance, that love leaks into universe and stains everything, that morning will bring reunion with someone whose voice paints colors that physics hasn't discovered.

The walls pulse with their shared frequency.

The impossible becomes daily.

The invisible prepares to be seen.

*End of Chapter 5*

**[Word Count: 5,634]**# Water Rising
*January 9, 2023, 9:47 PM - Storke Tower, Carillon Room*

---

## Arrival: The Last High Ground

Water sounds different when it's hunting you.

Not the gentle lap of ocean on sand that Chloe grew up with in Santa Barbara, not the musical trickle of the campus fountains where students make wishes. This water growls—deep frequency that her synesthesia translates into the color of endings: black-brown-silver with edges that taste like rust and regret.

They burst through the door of the carillon room—fifteen students total, all following the maintenance ghost and the girl who sees impossible things. The space is smaller than Chloe expected. Maybe twelve by twelve feet, cramped with the mechanical workings of the bells that mark campus hours. Cables and pulleys create a maze overhead. A single window on each wall. One door. No other exit.

"Jesus Christ, we're trapped," someone says—Brad from her discussion section, she thinks. His panic tastes purple-metallic in her mouth.

"We're alive," Hale counters, already at the east window, assessing. His accent thicker when stressed—Swedish consonants sharpening like ice, articles dropping. "Water at third step now. Five steps total."

Third step of the tower stairs. Five steps total before water reaches their level. Before the only room higher than flood becomes another kind of coffin.

The emergency lights here are different than in the main building—older, stranger. They cycle through wavelengths that make her tetrachromatic eyes scream with beauty and recognition. Every surface blazes with his hidden paintings—not just months but years of invisible messages suddenly visible, a gallery of devotion no one else could see.

"Holy shit," Emma breathes, spinning in a circle. "The walls—do you see—?"

"Power surge," Marcus says quickly. "Making weird shadows."

"That's not shadows," Emma insists. "There's paint—"

"Stress hallucinations," Brad cuts in. "Common in disasters. Just don't look at the walls."

But Chloe can't stop looking. 

This room is different from the hallways below. More concentrated. More intentional. The paintings here aren't random expressions—they're organized. Dated. Like diary entries in UV:

*September 2020: First day. No one sees.*  
*October 2020: Still alone.*  
*November 2020: Painted seventeen birds. Erased sixteen.*  
*December 2020: Someone moved the brushes I left. Hope?*  
*January 2021: False alarm. Janitor.*

Three years of isolation mapped in light only she can perceive.

---

## Hour One: Establishing Territory

"How long do we have?" A girl Chloe doesn't recognize, crying quietly.

Hale turns from the window. In UV light, his skin looks transparent—she can see veins like rivers, pulse points throbbing purple-blue, the specific geography of his fear mapped across his body like a second skeleton.

"Two hours. Maybe three if rising slows."

"We should try the roof—" Marcus starts.

"Padlocked. Already checked." Hale's checking windows now, methodical. "Sealed. Plexiglass. Would need tools we don't have."

"Our phones—"

"I have signal," the crying girl says. "Should I call—?"

"Everyone call," Marcus takes charge. "Different carriers, different towers. Someone will get through."

The room fills with the sound of dialing, busy signals, recorded messages about high call volume. Chloe watches Hale work—checking windows, testing the door lock, examining the bell mechanism for anything useful. His movements create heat trails in her vision, seventeen different temperatures that linger in the air like ghost doubles.

"I'm getting through!" Brad shouts. "911, yes, we're trapped in Storke Tower. The carillon room. Top floor. Fifteen people. Water rising."

Everyone falls silent, listening to his half of the conversation.

"No, we can't get to the roof. Yes, we tried. How long until—what do you mean you don't know? We have maybe two hours before—hello? Hello?"

He lowers the phone. "They said they know our location. Helicopters when they can. Storm's grounding everything right now."

"When they can?" Emma's voice cracks. "That's it?"

"That's it."

The room reorganizes itself into a geography of fear. Groups form—friends clutching friends, strangers becoming allies, couples curling together. Chloe finds herself standing apart, back against the north wall where the UV paintings are densest. Hale stands at the opposite wall, ten feet that might as well be ten miles or ten inches—distance doesn't work normally in crisis.

Their eyes meet across the human topology of panic.

"Everyone stay calm," Marcus announces, though his voice shakes. "We're in the highest point on campus. The water will stop before it reaches us."

"How do you know?" Emma asks.

"Physics," Marcus lies. "Water finds its level."

But Chloe can see the truth in UV paint on the wall behind him—Hale's calculations from some previous night: *Tower height: 175 feet. Hundred-year flood line: 180 feet. We are not safe.*

---

## Hour Two: Recognition in Crisis

People settle into waiting. Some cry quietly. Some tell jokes that fall flat. Brad finds a deck of cards in his backpack, starts a game no one really plays. Emma and her roommate share earbuds, music tinny in the frightened quiet.

Chloe stays by her wall, reading three years of Hale's isolation painted in frequencies only she can see. She's so absorbed she doesn't notice him approach until his heat signature enters her peripheral vision—seventeen distinct temperatures announcing him like fanfare.

"You're reading them," he says quietly, standing close enough that others might not hear.

"Every word."

"Three years of talking to no one."

"Not no one. You were talking to someone who didn't exist yet."

He looks at her sharply. "What do you mean?"

"I mean—" She traces a pattern on the wall, careful not to actually touch the wet paint. "October 2021. You painted 'I feel someone watching.' That was the day I started at UCSB. Transfer student. First time on campus."

His breath catches—she hears it as color, blue-white like frozen oxygen.

"November 2021," she continues. "You wrote 'The patterns are changing.' That's when I started leaving my arrangements around campus. Unconscious at first."

"December 2021—"

"'Someone's responding,'" he finishes. "Started noticing pencils arranged like my paintings. Thought I was going insane."

"January 2022: 'Not insane. Someone sees.'"

"February 2022: 'Painted her name but don't know it.'"

"March 2022: 'Call her Ghost Girl.'"

They're reading together now, their voices creating harmony that tastes gold-silver in her synesthetic perception.

"April 2022: 'Ghost Girl made a spiral. Matched my dream.'"

"May 2022: 'We're having a conversation.'"

"June 2022: 'I think I—'" Hale stops. The rest of the sentence is painted over, obscured.

"You think you what?"

"Doesn't matter."

"It's painted on the wall. In UV. For me to see."

"Not everything is for—" He stops again. Looks at her. Really looks. "Actually, yes. Everything here is for you. I just didn't know it was you specifically."

Water hits the first step below them. The sound changes—less approach, more arrival.

"One hour, maybe hour and half now," Hale announces to the room.

Several people start crying harder.

---

## Hour Three: Failed Rescue Attempt

"Signal's back!" The crying girl—Jennifer, Chloe's learned—waves her phone. "I'm calling my parents."

"No," Marcus says. "Call 911 again. Parents can't help."

"Fuck you, I'm calling my mom."

And she does. The conversation breaks everyone:

"Mom? Mom, I'm trapped. The flood. Storke Tower. I don't know when—I don't know if—tell Dad I love him. Tell Jeremy—"

Others start calling. The room fills with goodbyes disguised as check-ins, love disguised as logistics.

Hale's phone rings. He looks at the screen, surprised.

"Yes? We're in Storke Tower. Carillon room. Fifteen people." He listens, then speaks rapidly in Swedish. Then back to English: "Water at first step below our level. Rising approximately one foot every twenty minutes."

He holds the phone out. "They want to talk to someone else. Verify our location."

Chloe takes it without thinking.

"Hello?"

"Ma'am, we're coordinating rescue efforts. Can you describe your exact position?"

"Carillon room, top of Storke Tower. Fifteen people. Water at—" she looks at Hale, who checks the window.

"Fourth step now."

"Fourth step below us. The room is—" She looks around, and her tetrachromatic vision explodes with information only she can process. "The room is covered in UV paint. Invisible unless you have blacklight equipment. If you're sending helicopters, you could use UV spots to identify—"

"Ma'am, I need you to stay calm. Hallucinations are common in crisis situations."

"It's not hallucination. The paint is real. UV spectrum, 365 nanometers. The whole tower is covered in—"

"Ma'am, we're doing everything we can. Do you have any visible signals? Flares? Flashlights?"

"The UV paint IS visible. If you have the right equipment—"

"We need standard visible signals. Can someone else—"

She hangs up.

"They think I'm crazy."

"You're not crazy," Hale says immediately. "You see what exists."

"But if they can't see it—"

"Then we make our own signal."

He pulls out his UV pen—the one he was holding when the lights first died. Walks to the east window, the one facing the coast where rescue would come from. Starts writing backwards so it reads correctly from outside:

**HJÄLP = HELP**  
**15 MÄNNISKOR = 15 PEOPLE**  
**VATTEN STIGER = WATER RISING**

But he's not just writing—he's creating art. The letters overlap, interweave, form patterns that make her synesthesia explode. The Swedish and English blend into something universal, desperate, beautiful.

"They still won't see—" Brad starts.

"She sees it," Hale says simply. "That's enough."

"Enough for what?" Brad demands. "Enough to die knowing someone saw your art?"

"Yes," Hale and Chloe say simultaneously.

The room goes quiet.

---

## Hour Four: Trading Truths

Water enters their room. Just dampness at the doorway edge, but promise of more. Everyone moves to the center, clusters tightening. Chloe and Hale end up pressed against the north wall, close enough she can map his heat signature without trying—seventeen warms radiating like personal aurora.

"We should tell each other things," Emma announces suddenly. "Real things. In case—"

"Don't," Marcus cuts her off.

"No, she's right," Jennifer says. "I want someone to know. I cheated on my boyfriend. Three times. With his roommate."

The confession opens floodgates:

"I'm not actually pre-med. I'm failing chemistry."

"I stole money from my parents."

"I'm in love with my best friend's girlfriend."

"I haven't been to class all quarter."

The confessions circle the room like the water below—rising, inevitable.

"What about you?" Emma asks Chloe. "What's your secret?"

Chloe looks at the walls blazing with UV paint only she can see. At Hale, whose entire being exists in frequencies others can't perceive.

"I see colors that don't exist," she says.

"We all see weird stuff right now," Brad dismisses. "Stress hallucinations."

"No. Always. Since birth. I have four types of color cones instead of three. I see a hundred million colors where you see three million."

"That's not real," Marcus says.

"It's called tetrachromacy," Jennifer says unexpectedly. "We studied it in my neuro class. It's real. Rare as fuck, but real."

"You can see... more?" Emma asks.

"Different. I see into UV spectrum. And—" Chloe hesitates, then decides if they're dying, truth matters. "I have synesthesia. Colors become sounds become tastes become temperatures. Everything translates into everything else."

"Prove it," Brad challenges.

Chloe looks at him, lets her full perception unfold:

"Your fear tastes purple-metallic with edges of green. When you speak, your voice looks like yellow triangles. Your body temperature varies in twelve distinct zones—highest at your throat where panic lives, coolest at your fingers which you keep clenching. The playing card you're holding—seven of hearts—has a UV watermark from where someone with lotion touched it. The lotion had SPF, which glows at 380 nanometers."

Brad drops the card.

"The walls," Emma breathes. "You can actually see something on the walls."

"Paintings. Hundreds of them. UV paint. Three years worth." She looks at Hale. "All his."

"Why?" Jennifer asks him. "Why paint where no one can see?"

Hale's quiet for a moment. Then: "Because someone could see. Even if I never met them. Even if they never knew. Someone, somewhere, had the eyes to see. So I painted for them."

"For her," Brad says, understanding. "You painted for her specifically."

"I painted for whoever could see. It happened to be her."

"That's impossible. The odds—"

"One in seventeen million," Hale says. "I looked it up. Tetrachromacy with UV perception. One in seventeen million."

"And you just happened to both be here?"

"No," Chloe says. "We were called here. By the paintings. By the patterns. By each other."

---

## Hour Five: The True Conversation

Water reaches their ankles. Cold that transcends temperature, that her synesthesia translates into a color like death—black with edges of silver-white, the color of endings.

"Everyone on the desks," Marcus orders. "Highest ground."

They crowd onto the three desks, pressing close. Chloe ends up next to Hale, their bodies touching along one side—seventeen points of contact her brain processes as seventeen different colors, a rainbow only she can see.

"Tell me about the paintings," she says quietly, needing to understand before—before whatever comes.

So he does. Quietly, like bedtime story, like prayer, like confession. October third, the first spiral after seeing her arrangement. November fifteenth, the seventeen birds after she'd spent a day counting migrating pelicans. December first, the calendar painting after her advent Instagram posts.

"This one—" He points to a complex pattern near the ceiling. "January seven, last week. After you arranged those shells on the beach."

"You saw that?"

"I follow your Instagram. @ChloeMartinezArt. Been following since October."

"That's—" She wants to say creepy but it's not. It's desperate. It's lonely. It's exactly what she would have done.

"Invasive? Yes."

"Beautiful," she corrects. "To know someone was seeing. Even if I didn't know."

"The shimmer you mentioned. You really see heat trails?"

"From you, yes. Only you. Seventeen different temperatures that linger in air after you pass. Like ghost doubles. Like you exist more densely than other people."

"What do I look like? To you?"

Strange question when they might die. But also the only question worth asking.

"Like a galaxy," she says. "Like all the colors that shouldn't exist decided to become a person. Like art that learned to walk."

He laughs—sound that looks golden in her peripheral vision, tastes like honey mixed with snow.

"What do I look like to you?" she asks.

"Like the answer to a question I didn't know I was asking."

Water at their knees now. The others are crying, praying, calling families again. But Chloe and Hale exist in a bubble of impossible perception, speaking in frequencies only they can hear.

---

## Hour Six: The Phone Call That Changes Everything

Hale's phone rings again. Different ringtone—personal, not official.

He answers in Swedish, rapid-fire. His face changes—hope? Fear? Something between?

He hands the phone to Chloe. "For you."

"Hello?"

"Is this Chloe Martinez?" Female voice, older, authoritative.

"Yes?"

"Dr. Karina Lindqvist. Hale's mother. I'm at UC Berkeley. Neuroscience department. He says you're tetrachromatic."

"I—yes."

"With UV perception?"

"Yes."

"And you can see his paintings?"

"All of them."

"Listen carefully. I've been studying tetrachromacy for twenty years. Started when Hale was born—he has partial tetrachromacy. Not enough for full spectrum but enough to sense what he can't quite see. That's why he paints in UV. He's painting toward his partial perception."

"Partial—"

"One in thirty million. The odds of you two meeting—"

"One in infinity."

"Yes. You're matched pairs. Genetically, neurologically, perceptually matched. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

Water at their thighs. Time running out.

"We were meant to find each other."

"More than that. You complete each other's vision. Together you see spectrums that don't exist for anyone else, even other tetrachromats."

"How do you—"

"Because I've been looking for someone like you his whole life. Someone who could see what he paints toward. He paints what he almost sees. You see what he reaches for."

The phone cuts out.

"Your mother—" Chloe starts.

"Is why I knew to look for you. She's been researching tetrachromacy since I was diagnosed with partial. Said someday I'd find my match."

"Match?"

"Person who could see what I almost see. Person whose vision completes mine."

Water rising faster now. Up to their waists as they stand on the desks.

"If we die—" Chloe starts.

"We won't."

"But if—"

"Then we die seeing each other. Really seeing. How many people can say that?"

---

## Hour Seven: The Kiss and The Light

The water stops.

Just stops.

Waist-deep, but not rising.

"Something's changed," Marcus says. "A dam? Diversion?"

"Does it matter?" Emma asks.

"It means we might make it."

The room reorganizes again—from death preparation to survival hope. But Chloe stays pressed against Hale, reading the last paintings he did this week. Frantic ones. Desperate ones.

"These are different," she says, tracing a pattern from two nights ago. "More urgent."

"I felt you coming closer. Following the trails. Had to paint faster. Say everything before—"

"Before what?"

"Before you saw them. Before you ran. Before you realized I'd been watching, painting you, falling in—"

He stops.

"Falling in what?"

"Look at the ceiling."

She does. There, in UV paint so fresh it still drips, painted in the last hour while they've been trapped:

*Jag älskar dig*  
*Jeg elsker deg*  
*Te amo*  
*I love you*

Four languages. Same message. Painted over and over, a mandala of confession.

"You don't know me," she says.

"I know you see seventeen warms when I touch things. I know you count colors compulsively. I know you arrange objects in patterns that match paintings you've never seen. I know you're the only person who can see what I create. I know you stayed on campus during break because being alone is easier than pretending to be normal. I know—"

She kisses him.

Not desperate. Not frantic. Slow. Like they have forever instead of minutes.

The kiss creates its own spectrum in her synesthetic perception—not metaphor but literal neurological event. Her four types of cones fire simultaneously. Colors explode behind her eyelids: gold-silver-pearl with edges of UV she has no name for. The kiss tastes like electricity and snow, like midnight and noon occupying the same moment. It sounds like symphony written in frequencies only she can hear—seventeen different notes corresponding to seventeen different temperatures where their bodies touch.

Time dilates. Each second stretches into minutes. The water stops existing. The frightened people disappear. The universe contracts to the space between two people who see impossible things, finding each other in disaster.

When they part, she's crying. But the tears taste sweet—relief mixed with recognition mixed with something that might be love if love can bloom in flood.

"Look," Emma gasps.

They turn.

Lights. Outside. Helicopters. Multiple. The sound of salvation arriving exactly when they'd given up hope.

---

## Hour Eight: What Remains

Chaos. Rescue baskets. One person at a time. Chloe and Hale pushed to opposite sides as the room reorganizes around evacuation.

"Women first," someone says.

"Injured first," the rescue worker corrects through the megaphone.

"We stay together," Hale shouts across the chaos. "Chloe, we stay—"

But she's already being pushed toward the window, the basket, salvation.

"Your name," she shouts back. "Your full name!"

"Hale Marcus Lindqvist! Uppsala! February nineteen—"

The rest lost in rotor wash.

She's in the basket. Rising. Away from him. Away from the UV paintings. Away from the only person who exists in as many dimensions as she can perceive.

But she remembers the paintings on the walls. The conversation they had before they knew they were having it. The seventeen warms that will let her find him anywhere.

The helicopter rises, and she sees the campus transformed into ocean. Sees the tower like a lighthouse in the dark. Sees, in UV frequencies visible only to her through the rain, his message glowing on every surface:

*Find me.*  
*I'll find you.*  
*We already found each other.*

The water might separate them. Different helicopters. Different hospitals. Different evacuations.

But they speak in frequencies others can't perceive. They'll find each other the way they did the first time—through impossible colors, through invisible art, through patterns that match across any distance.

The helicopter banks toward the hospital.

Below, the flood continues.

Above, their conversation continues too—painted in light only they can see.

## Part 1: Water at the Door

Water touches the door.

Not enters. Touches. Like a predator testing the boundaries of its prey, patient and inevitable.

"Oh god oh god oh god—" Jennifer's litany from the corner where she's curled, as far from the door as physics allows.

"It's slowing," Marcus lies, though his voice cracks. "Look—it's definitely slowing."

"Shut up, Marcus." Brad's given up on false hope. "We're fucked."

Chloe stands on the desk—highest point in a shrinking world. Hale beside her, his heat signature seventeen different temperatures that her synesthesia converts to sound: a low hum like cello strings tightening before they snap.

"How long?" Her voice doesn't shake. Past fear now. Into whatever comes after.

He checks the door. Water seeps underneath—dark fingers reaching. "Twenty minutes. Maybe less."

"Twenty minutes," Emma repeats. "That's—that's nothing. That's one episode of The Office minus commercials. That's—"

"Stop," her roommate says. "Please."

The emergency lights flicker. Battery dying. Soon darkness will swallow the UV paintings, erase their invisible gallery, make everything equally nothing.

"I need to tell you—" Chloe starts.

"I need to tell you—" Hale says at the same moment.

They stop. Look at each other. In failing light, his face shifts through spectrums—visible to UV to something beyond classification. Her tetrachromatic eyes catch frequencies that exist only in this moment: fear-silver, resignation-gold, something else that might be love if love had a color at the end of the world.

"You first," she says.

"No, you—"

"Someone fucking say something," Brad snaps. "We're about to drown."

"Exactly," Chloe says, turning to face Hale fully. "We're about to drown. So—"

"So?"

"So there are rules. When you're drowning. Things you're supposed to say."

"What rules?" Hale's accent thickens. "What things?"

"I don't know. Last words. Confessions. The stuff you'd regret not saying."

"You have regrets? Already? We just met four hours ago."

"Five hours. And that's not—I mean—" She's fumbling, words scattering like startled fish. "Don't you have things? To say? Before?"

"Before we die?"

"Stop saying die," Jennifer wails.

"Before whatever happens," Chloe corrects. "Yes."

---

## Part 2: Fumbling Toward Truth

Water reaches their ankles on the desk. The cold transcends temperature—her synesthesia reads it as the color of endings: black-silver-pearl with edges that taste like copper snow.

"Okay," Hale says. "Things to say. You want—what? Truth?"

"Truth would be good."

"Truth." He laughs, but it's edged with hysteria. "Sanningen. Swedish for truth. But also means 'the thing that burns.'"

"Why does it burn?"

"Because truth always burns. Like UV light. Invisible but causes damage."

"That's cheerful."

"You want cheerful? Now?"

"I want—" What does she want? "I want to understand. This. Us. How we—"

"How we what?"

"You know what."

"Say it."

"You say it."

"For fuck's sake," Brad interrupts. "You two have been having eye sex for five hours. Just admit you're into each other so we can all die in peace."

Heat floods Chloe's face—she knows it registers as seventeen different temperatures that Hale can probably sense even if he can't fully see.

"It's not—we're not—"

"We are," Hale says quietly.

She turns to him. "We are?"

"Aren't we?"

"I'm asking you."

"I'm asking you back."

"That's not how questions work—"

"Will you two just KISS already?" Emma shouts. "The water's at our knees and you're debating semantics!"

---

## Part 3: The Swedish Lesson

"There's a word," Hale says suddenly. "In Swedish."

"Tell me."

"It doesn't translate."

"Try anyway."

"Färgsjäl."

The word hangs between them, unfamiliar and beautiful.

"What does it mean?"

"Color-soul. But not—more than that. Person who sees the same colors you see. Impossible colors."

"That's not a real word."

"No."

"You made it up."

"Yes."

"When?"

"Three years ago."

"For?"

"For whoever was answering my paintings. Before I knew who. Before I knew you."

Chloe's breath catches. "You made up a word for me before you met me?"

"I made up seventeen words for you."

"Seventeen." Of course. Their number. "Tell me another."

"Ljusvän."

"Which means?"

"Light-friend. No—light-twin. Same light, different eyes."

"Another."

"Synvidd."

"Translation?"

"Sight-width. The range of what we see together."

"That's three. Fourteen more."

"We don't have time—"

Water rises to their thighs. The desk shifts, unstable.

"Then talk faster."

He rapid-fires Swedish: "Mörkerglow. Spektrumspar. Frekvenskärlek. Osynligband. Färgminne. Ljuslängtan. Våglängdsvän. Nyansdröm. Ultrasjäl. Prismahjärta. Solospråk. Tystsamtal. Ögonbrev."

"What do they mean?"

"Darkness-glow. Spectrum-pair. Frequency-love. Invisible-bond. Color-memory. Light-longing. Wavelength-friend. Nuance-dream. Ultra-soul. Prism-heart. Solo-language. Silent-conversation. Eye-letter."

"Those are all about us."

"They're all about looking for you."

---

## Part 4: The Failed Confession

"I have to tell you something," Chloe says. "Before we—before whatever happens."

"Tell me."

"That night in October. When you painted the first spiral. I felt it."

"Felt it?"

"Like—gravity but sideways. I was in the library, arranging study guides. And suddenly I knew someone was creating something. Could feel the paint touching walls across campus."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible."

"October third? Two AM?"

"October third. Two thirteen AM. I checked my phone."

His hand finds hers under the water—seventeen different temperatures converging into a single point of contact.

"I labeled that painting," he says. "In Swedish. 'För någon som kanske känner.' For someone who might feel."

"I felt it."

"You felt it."

"Is that weird?"

"Everything about this is weird."

"I mean weirder than the rest."

"Chloe—"

"What?"

"We're about to die."

"Maybe."

"Probably."

"So?"

"So stop asking if things are weird. Ask if they're true."

"Are they true?"

"What's true is—" He stops. Swallows. Tries again. "What's true is I painted five hundred invisible messages hoping someone might see one."

"Four hundred ninety-seven."

"You counted?"

"I count everything. Compulsion."

"What number am I?"

"What?"

"You count everything. What number am I?"

"Seventeen. Always seventeen. Seventeen warms, seventeen touches, seventeen—"

He kisses her.

---

## Part 5: The Kiss (Full Synesthetic Breakdown)

Not graceful. Not perfect. They're standing in rising water, death circling, audience of terrified students. 

His hands are shaking. Her teeth hit his. Someone says "finally" but the word dissolves because—

The world explodes into frequencies.

She doesn't just feel the kiss—she experiences it in dimensions that shouldn't exist:

**Visual**: Behind closed eyes, not darkness but explosion. Geometries of light pulse gold-silver-UV-infinite, spreading like backwards lightning, like northern lights in reverse, like the birth of colors that have never existed. She sees the kiss as fractal pattern—each point of contact spawning seventeen new spectrums, those spawning seventeen more, infinite regression of impossible light.

**Auditory**: The kiss creates actual sound—vibration her tetrachromatic brain interprets as symphony. But wrong. Symphony in keys that haven't been invented, notes between notes, harmonics that exist in frequencies only she can hear. It sounds like:
- His heartbeat (percussion in seventeen rhythms)
- Her blood rushing (strings in UV)
- Their breath mingling (woodwinds in colors)
- The water below (bass note in death's frequency)
- All of it together: music that tastes purple-gold

**Gustatory**: His mouth tastes like:
- Mint (but seventeen different mints)
- Copper (the flavor of fear)
- Snow (Swedish winter he carries)
- Electricity (synapses firing)
- Salt (tears? flood? both?)
- Something ancient, pre-language, like the first word ever spoken before words existed

**Olfactory**: Layers of scent that her synesthesia translates:
- Swedish pine (his shampoo)
- California sage (her home)
- Salt water (death approaching)
- UV paint (their language)
- Ozone (the smell of neural connection)
- Petrichor (rain but also tears but also ending but also beginning)

**Tactile**: Seventeen different pressures where they touch:
- Lips: 2.3 PSI, reads as golden-warm-center
- His hand on her waist: five different pressures for five fingers
- Her hand on his neck: palm and four fingers, each unique
- Where their chests meet: distributed pressure map
- The water around them: negative pressure, cold absence
- All seventeen points create constellation her body reads as "home"

**Temporal**: Time breaks. The kiss lasts:
- Three seconds (Marcus counts out loud)
- Three minutes (Jennifer's perception)
- Three hours (in UV time)
- Three lifetimes (in synaptic time)
- All simultaneously true

**New Sense - The Seventh**: Something beyond the six. Beyond synesthesia. Like recognizing someone's soul by its frequency. Like touching the source code of existence. Like finding the person whose vision completes yours.

The emergency light dies completely.

Absolute darkness.

But she still sees him—not with eyes but with whatever sense recognizes matching frequencies in blackness.

They break apart, gasping.

"Holy shit," Brad says in the darkness. "That was—did anyone else feel that?"

"Feel what?" Emma asks.

"Like—electricity? The air changed. Something—"

"I felt it," Jennifer whispers. "Like the universe hiccupped."

---

## Part 6: After (In Complete Darkness)

"I see you," Chloe says against his mouth. "Even in darkness. Especially in darkness."

"How?"

"Your heat signature. Seventeen points of warmth. You're shaped like a constellation only I can see."

"What constellation?"

"New one. Ours."

"That was—" He stops. No words in Swedish or English.

"Yeah."

"Is it always—do you always—when you kiss someone—?"

"No. Never. That was—"

"First time?"

"First time seeing kiss. Usually just feel."

"You SAW it?"

"Fractals. Infinite color regression. You?"

"I—something. Not full sight but—edges. Borders. Like almost seeing but more."

"Your partial tetrachromacy?"

"Activated. By you. By us."

Water at their chests now. They're treading water in absolute darkness, but somehow coordinated. His arm around her waist, her hand on his shoulder, both kicking in rhythm they haven't learned but know.

"Listen," he says suddenly.

"What?"

"The water. Listen."

Silence. Not just quiet. Absence. 

"It stopped," she breathes. "The water stopped rising."

"We're not dying?"

"Not yet."

"Oh thank god," Jennifer sobs in the darkness. "Thank god thank god—"

"The kiss," Brad says. "You two kissed and the water stopped. That's—that's biblical or something."

"That's coincidence," Marcus the scientist corrects.

"That's timing," Emma adds.

But Chloe thinks: *That's us. We create impossible things. Why not impossible survival?*

---

## Part 7: Floating in Darkness (Attempting Future)

"What happens now?" she asks. They're floating together, no other choice. The desk submerged somewhere below.

"Now we wait."

"I mean after. If we—when we—"

"When we survive?"

"Yes."

"I don't know. What do people do when they survive impossible things together?"

"Usually? Trauma bond then never speak again."

"Is that what you want?"

"No."

"What do you want?"

"I want—" The darkness makes it easier to say. "I want to make things with you."

"Things?"

"Art. In frequencies only we can see."

"Together?"

"Is there another way? You paint toward what you almost see. I see what you're reaching for. We're—"

"Complementary?"

"Necessary. To each other."

His hand finds hers under the water. Seventeen warms in the cold flood.

"I'm going to say something," he says. "And it's too soon and we just met and we might still die—"

"Say it."

"In Swedish or English?"

"Both."

"Jag—" He stops. Breathes. "I think I—"

"Me too."

"You don't know what I was going to—"

"Yes I do."

"How?"

"Because I'm thinking it too. Feeling it. In seventeen different frequencies."

"Say it then."

"You first."

"Together?"

"On three?"

They count. Not to three. To seventeen. Their number.

"I love you," they say. Not simultaneously. Overlapping. His words in Swedish-accented English, hers in California angles, but same impossibility.

"That's insane," she adds immediately.

"Completely," he agrees.

"We just met."

"Five hours ago."

"In a flood."

"While possibly dying."

"This is trauma response."

"Definitely."

"Adrenaline."

"Probably."

"We should ignore it."

"Absolutely."

Beat.

"But?" he prompts.

"But it's also true."

"The truest thing I know."

"That's terrifying."

"Ja. Skrämmande."

"What?"

"Terrifying in Swedish. Sounds scarier."

She laughs—in the darkness it creates its own light, golden static visible in her peripheral vision.

---

## Part 8: Dawn's Revelation

Light creeps through windows. Not much. Dawn struggling through storm clouds. But enough.

The room reveals itself in stages:
- Water, chest-high, black with debris
- Fifteen people floating, exhausted, still alive
- UV paintings, somehow still visible in dawn's specific frequency
- Them, still together, still impossible

"Look," Chloe says, pointing up.

On the ceiling—the only surface Hale couldn't reach—she sees it clearly with her tetrachromatic eyes:

Someone else's UV painting. Older. Different hand. Different frequency—380 nanometers instead of Hale's 365.

Words in spectrum only she can process: "Love persists in frequencies beyond visible."

"You didn't paint that."

"No."

"Then who—?"

"Someone like us. Before us."

"There were others?"

"Must have been."

"Other tetrachromats? Other UV painters?"

"Other impossible pairs."

She processes this. They're not unique. Not the first. Others have found each other through invisible spectrums.

"That's—"

"Lonely?"

"Beautiful. It means we're not alone. Not just us two but—pattern. Throughout time. People finding each other in frequencies others can't see."

Voices outside. Helicopters. Real rescue this time. 

"They're here!" Marcus shouts. "We made it! Everyone—we made it!"

Chaos. People crying with relief. Brad actually hugs Jennifer. Emma and her roommate clutch each other.

But Chloe and Hale stay still, reading the ceiling message together.

"Ready?" he asks.

"For rescue?"

"For everything. After. The real world. Where we have to explain—" He gestures between them. "This. Us. Meeting in flood and falling in—"

"Falling in frequencies."

"That. Yes."

"No one will understand."

"No."

"They'll say it's trauma bond."

"It is."

"They'll say we're crazy."

"We are."

"They'll try to separate us."

"They will."

"So?"

"So we don't let them."

The ladder appears at the window. Rescue worker shouting instructions.

"Promise me," Chloe says urgently. "When we get separated—and we will, different helicopters, different hospitals—promise you'll find me."

"How?"

"Same way as before. Leave UV messages. I'll see them."

"Where?"

"Everywhere. Every wall you can find. I'll do the same."

"Our invisible conversation."

"Continuing."

"Even separated."

"Especially separated."

"Women first!" the rescue worker shouts.

Hands pulling her toward the ladder.

"Your name!" she shouts to Hale over the chaos. "Your full name!"

"Hale Marcus Lindqvist! Uppsala! February nineteen—"

But she's already in the basket, rising, away from him, from their tower, from the only person who exists in as many dimensions as she can perceive.

As the helicopter lifts, she sees him pressed against the window, painting something with his finger in the condensation—invisible to others but she can see it in the dawn light:

*Jag hittar dig*

I'll find you.

She presses her hand to the helicopter window, knows he can't see but does it anyway:

*Jag väntar*

I'll wait.

Twenty months she'll wait.

But they've already proven they can find each other through impossible frequencies.

The flood separates them.

The conversation continues.

## Part 1: Different Worlds

Different tents. Different colors. Different worlds.

Chloe stands in Red Cross Station B, still wrapped in someone else's blanket that smells like someone else's disaster—cigarette smoke and fear-sweat and something medicinal. Through the tent flap, she can see Station A—where they took him. Maybe. If he made it down. If another helicopter came. If, if, if.

"Name?"

Third time they've asked. Third time she's answered. Third time they write it wrong.

"Chloe Martinez." She spells it. "M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z."

"Age?"

"Twenty-three. Listen, I was in Storke Tower with—"

"We have you logged." The volunteer—name tag says BRENDA—doesn't look up from her clipboard. "Storke Tower, rescued 6:47 AM. Solo evacuation."

"Not solo. There were fifteen of us. There was someone—a man—Swedish—"

"Sweetie, I need you to focus. Medical conditions? Injuries?"

"I'm fine. But the Swedish man—tall, blonde, paint under his fingernails—"

"Are you hurt?"

"No, but—"

"Next of kin?"

"My parents, but they're fine, they're in Ventura. Please, I need to find—"

"Maria Martinez is looking for you. Your sister?"

"My friend. Where is she?"

"Station C. But you need to finish processing—"

Chloe's already moving.

---

## Part 2: Maria's Arrival

"CHLOE!"

Maria slams into her like a small hurricane, crying and laughing simultaneously. "Oh my god, I thought—when they said Storke Tower flooded—Jesus, Chloe, I thought you were dead."

"I'm okay. I'm—Maria, I need your help."

"You're shaking." Maria pulls back, studies her. "And you're—different. What happened?"

"There was someone. In the tower. We—"

"Chloe Elena Martinez, where the HELL have you been?" Another voice. Angry. Scared. 

Her cousin David, still in his pajamas, clearly drove here straight from bed.

"The tower—"

"Your parents are losing their minds. Your mom's having a breakdown. She keeps saying something about colors?"

"David, please, I need to find someone—"

"You need to call your mother."

"My phone's dead. Water."

"Use mine." He shoves it at her.

"In a minute. First I need—"

"Chloe." Maria's using her careful voice. "Who do you need to find?"

"His name is Hale. Hale Lindqvist. Swedish. He was in the tower with me."

"Your boyfriend?" David asks.

"No. Yes. I don't—it's complicated."

Maria and David exchange looks.

"How long have you been dating this guy?" David demands.

"Five hours."

"What?"

"We met during the flood. But also before. Kind of. Through art. It's—I can't explain right now. I just need to find him."

"Chloe." Maria takes her shoulders. "You're in shock. You're not thinking clearly."

"I'm thinking more clearly than ever. He sees—" She stops. Can't explain about the UV, the tetrachromacy, the seventeen warms. "Please. Just help me look for him."

---

## Part 3: The Lists

She finds the board where they're posting names.

*Station A Arrivals - Updated 8 AM*

"Help me look," she begs Maria. "Hale Lindqvist. Or maybe Lars—"

"Lars?"

"His middle name maybe? Or—shit, what if they wrote it wrong? Swedish names—"

"Chloe, breathe."

She scans. No Hale. No Lars. No Lindqvist. No Holstrom—wait, why is she looking for Holstrom?

But there—handwritten addition at bottom:
*Swedish male, 20s, no ID*

Her heart does something impossible—stops and races simultaneously. 

"That's him!" She grabs the nearest volunteer. "The Swedish male—where is he?"

"Transferred to County Medical. Hypothermia."

"When?"

"Twenty minutes ago."

Twenty minutes. Always twenty minutes too late.

"I need to get to County Medical."

"Roads are closed, honey. Emergency vehicles only."

"Then I'll walk."

"It's six miles and half of it's flooded."

"I'll swim."

"Chloe, stop." Maria grabs her arm. "You can't swim to the hospital."

"Watch me."

"This is crazy. You don't even know if it's him."

"It's him."

"How do you know?"

"I just—I know. Seventeen reasons I know."

"Seventeen? That's weirdly specific."

"Everything about him is seventeen."

---

## Part 4: The Phone Call Attempts

David's phone in her hand. She doesn't know Hale's number. Of course she doesn't. They were too busy drowning and kissing and seeing impossible colors.

"Information? I need a number for Hale Lindqvist. L-I-N-D-Q-V-I-S-T."

"City?"

"Santa Barbara. Or—maybe Uppsala? Sweden?"

"No listing under that name."

She tries variations:
"Lars Lindqvist?"
"H. Lindqvist?"
"Hale Marcus?"

Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

"The university. He's maintenance staff."

"UCSB has no employee by that name."

Because he's invisible. Always has been. Ghost painter. Ghost person. Ghost everything except to her.

"Chloe, honey." A new voice. Older. She looks up—Red Cross coordinator, badge says JANET. "I heard you're looking for someone from the tower."

"Yes! Swedish, about six-two, green eyes—"

"We have several unidentified evacuees. If you could look at photos—"

"Yes. Please."

Janet pulls out a tablet. Swipes through images. Unconscious faces on gurneys. Water-pale. Some breathing tubes. All strangers.

"None of these."

"These are all the males, 20-30, from tower rescues."

"He's not here."

"Then he might be at Station A or—"

"Or dead." David says it flat. "He might be dead, Chloe."

"He's not dead."

"How do you know?"

"Because I can still—" Feel his seventeen warms? See UV paint pulsing? Taste the kiss in frequencies? "I just know."

---

## Part 5: Wrong Names Everywhere

Maria finds a volunteer with a laptop, convinced them to search.

"Spell it again?"

"L-I-N-D-Q-V-I-S-T. Or try L-I-N-D-K-V-I-S-T. Or—"

"Nothing. But we have a Lars Holstrom?"

"That's—maybe? Try it."

The volunteer types. "Lars Holstrom, 24, evacuated from..." She squints. "Anacapa Hall. Not the tower."

Not him. But why does Holstrom sound familiar?

"What about partial names? Just 'Swedish'?"

"We don't search by nationality."

"Please. He's tall, blonde—"

"You've described half of UCSB."

"Paint. He had paint under his fingernails. UV paint."

The volunteer looks at her strangely. "UV paint?"

"It's—never mind."

---

## Part 6: Marcus and Emma

"Chloe?"

She spins. Marcus and Emma from the tower, wrapped in matching Red Cross blankets.

"You made it!" Emma runs to her. "We thought—when you went first—the helicopter—"

"Did you see him? After I left? Did Hale—"

"The Swedish guy?" Marcus nods. "He went in the second helicopter. Maybe five minutes after you."

"Which hospital?"

"I don't know. They were splitting between County and Cottage."

"Did he say anything? Before he left?"

Emma and Marcus exchange glances.

"He was...agitated," Emma says carefully. "Kept saying something in Swedish."

"What?"

"I don't know. Something like 'yog hit-tar'?"

"Jag hittar," Chloe breathes. "I'll find."

"You speak Swedish?" Marcus asks.

"No. Yes. Seventeen words of it."

They look at her like she's lost her mind. Maybe she has.

---

## Part 7: Breakdown

"I need to check Cottage Hospital."

"Chloe, you need to rest." Maria's using her mom-voice. "You've been through trauma—"

"You don't understand. He sees—we see—together we—" How to explain? "He painted messages only I could see. For three years. And I answered without knowing. We were having a conversation before we met."

"That doesn't make sense."

"Nothing about us makes sense! I have four color cones. He has partial tetrachromacy. We see UV spectrums. Together we see impossible things."

"Chloe—"

"I know how it sounds. Crazy. Impossible. But it's real. The seventeen warms are real. The paintings are real. He's real."

"Okay." Maria takes her hands. "Okay. Say it's all real. You still need to rest. Eat. Call your parents. Then we'll look."

"But—"

"He's not disappearing. If he's real, if this connection is real, you'll find each other."

"We already lost each other once. For twenty months. I can't—"

"Twenty months? But you just met—"

"That's the problem with time. It's not linear. Not for us."

---

## Part 8: The Wrong Name

Chloe's about to give up when Jennifer from the tower appears.

"Chloe! Thank god. I've been looking for you."

"Jennifer. You made it."

"We all did. Even that Swedish guy you were with."

"You saw him? Where?"

"County Medical. But—"

"He's there? You're sure?"

"Yes, but Chloe—"

She's already moving.

"Wait! They have his name wrong!"

Chloe stops. Turns.

"What?"

"The Swedish guy. They wrote down the wrong name. He kept trying to correct them but his English got all scrambled and they wrote Lars Holberg or Holbrook or something."

Holbrook.

The name hits like ice water.

"Holbrook?"

"Something like that. Why?"

Because Holbrook is the one who accused him. The one whose father owns galleries. The one who forced Hale to become invisible.

"They won't let me see him. If the name's wrong, they won't—"

"So tell them the right name."

"They won't believe me. I'm not family. I'm not even—we're not—"

"You're something. Everyone in that tower could see it."

"See what?"

"The way you two looked at each other. Like you were seeing colors the rest of us couldn't."

If only she knew.

---

## Part 9: The Call to His Mother

Maria's phone. International charges be damned.

"Directory assistance for Uppsala, Sweden. Dr. Karina Lindqvist. Neuroscience department."

Miracle—they have her.

Ringing. Swedish ringback tone, different rhythm.

"Hej, detta är Karina."

"Dr. Lindqvist? This is Chloe Martinez. I was with Hale—"

"Chloe!" The switch to English is instant. "Is he all right? The news says flooding—"

"He's alive. Hospital. But they have his name wrong. They won't let me see him."

"What name do they have?"

"Lars Holbrook or Holberg."

Silence. Then: "Holbrook. Of course. The universe has a cruel sense of humor."

"Can you call? Tell them his real name?"

"I'll do better. I'm flying out. Tonight. But Chloe—"

"Yes?"

"He'll look for you. The moment he can."

"How do you know?"

"Because he's been looking for you for three years. He won't stop now."

"But if they have his name wrong—if I can't find him—"

"You found each other through invisible paintings. You'll find each other through this."

"The paintings. Of course. He'll leave messages."

"Where?"

"Everywhere. Starting with—" She thinks. Where would he go first? "The library. Where we met. Really met."

"Then go there."

"But the hospital—"

"Trust the invisible frequencies, Chloe. They've worked so far."

---

## Part 10: The Decision

"I'm going to the library," Chloe announces.

"The library's flooded," David protests.

"The upper floors aren't."

"Why the library?" Maria asks.

"Because that's where we found each other. That's where he'll leave a message."

"Chloe, this is crazy."

"Everything about us is crazy." She stands, sheds the disaster blanket. "I have tetrachromacy. I see a hundred million colors. He paints in UV. We found each other through invisible art. Crazy is our normal."

"Tetra-what?"

"I'll explain later. After I find him."

"How will you even get there? The roads—"

"I'll walk."

"I'll drive you," Maria says suddenly.

"Maria—"

"If this is real—this connection—then you need to find him. And if it's not real, if it's trauma response, then you need to know that too."

"It's real."

"Then let's go find your UV painter."

They leave the emergency station. Outside, the sun breaks through clouds for the first time in days. It hits at thirty-seven degrees—the angle that makes UV visible to her tetrachromatic eyes.

And there, on the sidewalk, in paint so fresh it's still wet:

*CM + HL*

Their initials. In UV only she can see.

He's already leaving trails.

The conversation continues.

Even separated.

Even with wrong names.

Even in chaos.

They're still finding each other through impossible frequencies.

*End of Chapter 8*

**[Word Count: 5,489]**# Seventeen Warms
*September 18, 2024 - Coffee Shop on State Street*

---

## Part 1: Seventeen Minutes Early

The coffee shop on State Street smells wrong.

Not bad—just wrong. Like they've tried to recreate what existed before the flood but the proportions shifted. Too much vanilla. Not enough dust. The kind of wrong only someone with synesthetic tetrachromacy would notice—vanilla reads as amber-white but this amber has blue edges, disaster-tinged, like everything since.

Chloe arrives seventeen minutes early.

Of course seventeen. Everything is seventeen now.

Parks herself at the corner table where she can see both entrances, the window, the back exit she mapped within seconds of arrival. Habits from twenty months of searching—always watching for a tall Swedish silhouette that never appeared.

Until yesterday.

"What can I get you?" The barista—nose ring, flood survivor tattoo on her wrist—hovers with practiced patience.

"Just water. I'm waiting for someone."

"Date?". Over familiar.  Wrong country. Forced. 

"Research meeting."

The barista smirks. " I could do with some research myself. Been months."

Bitchy. Or Flirty. Not sure. She should stop talking.

"It's about parallel creation during trauma separation."

"he cute?"

"I didn't say it was a he."

"You didn't have to. You've checked the door seventeen times since you sat down."

Seventeen. Always seventeen.

Chloe's hands automatically arrange the sugar packets by their color frequencies—white has twelve variants if you count the UV spectrum bleeding through the window. Sweet'N Low pink screams at wavelength that tastes like artificial strawberries. The brown sugars sing bass notes only she can hear.

"Nervous habit," she says.

"The counting or the arranging?"

"Both."

"My ex did that. The arranging thing. Said it helped with anxiety."

"Did it?"

"No. We broke up during the flood. He took a different helicopter."

The barista walks away before Chloe can respond. Different helicopters. The phrase lodges in her chest like shrapnel.

2:47 PM.

---

## Part 2: The Hovering

She sees him before he enters.

Not him—his reflection. In the window across the street, distorted by afternoon sun hitting at thirty-seven degrees, the same angle that makes UV visible. He's standing outside. Has been for—she counts his micro-movements—at least three minutes.

He's nervous.

His heat signature through glass reads as purple-gold anxiety, the color of someone trying to decide whether to run.

Her phone buzzes. Text from Maria:
*"How's the 'research meeting'?"*

She types back: *"He's been standing outside for three minutes."*

*"Nervous?"*

*"We both are."*

*"Why? You already kissed during apocalypse. This should be easy."*

Should be. Isn't.

She texts: *"Apocalypse kiss doesn't count."*

*"All kisses count."*

*"Not if you think you're dying."*

*"ESPECIALLY if you think you're dying."*

Hale moves. Finally. Hand on door handle. Still not pulling.

Another text from Maria: *"Is he coming in or not?"*

*"Unknown."*

*"Want me to come push him?"*

*"No."*

*"Want me to come push YOU?"*

*"Maria. Stop."*

*"You spent 20 months looking for him."*

*"I know."*

*"So stop texting me and go talk to him."*

But then he turns, and their eyes meet through two panes of glass, across twenty feet of space, and her tetrachromacy explodes into recognition—

Seventeen. Always seventeen. Seventeen different blues in his eyes even from this distance. Seventeen degrees of warmth radiating from his body. Seventeen micro-expressions crossing his face in the span of one breath.

He enters.

---

## Part 3: The Awkward Beginning

"Hi."

"Hi."

They stare. The coffee shop continues around them—espresso machine hissing, students typing, world spinning—but they're frozen.

"You came," she says. Then immediately: "Obviously you came. You're here. That was stupid."

"Not stupid."

"Obvious though."

"I almost didn't."

"Come?"

"Mm."

"Why?"

"Because what if—" He stops. Swallows. "What if yesterday was—what if we imagined—"

"The connection?"

"The everything."

She wants to reach across the table but doesn't. Not yet. "We didn't imagine it."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're still seventeen."

"Seventeen?"

"Different temperatures. Where you're warm. I can count them. See them. You're the only person who registers as seventeen."

"That's—"

"Impossible. I know."

"I was going to say specific."

"That too."

Awkward pause. He looks at the wall—local art display. One piece has a small gallery sticker in the corner: 'Holbrook Contemporary.' His jaw tightens. His heat signature spikes—anger-orange bleeding into the seventeen warms.

"You know that gallery?" she asks.

"James Holbrook. His father's gallery."

"The one who—"

"Accused me. Yes."

"Why is his art here?"

"His art is everywhere. Money buys wall space."

"Is that why you paint in UV? Where money can't buy visibility?"

He looks at her sharply. "Maybe. I hadn't thought—maybe."

---

## Part 4: The Research Project Pretense

"So," he says. "Research project."

"Right. Research."

"You want to document—what exactly?"

"Um. Parallel creation during trauma separation."

"That's very specific."

"And unconscious communication through invisible art."

"Even more specific."

"Too specific?"

"Very oddly specific."

"I could make it broader—"

"No. Specific is good. We're specific."

The barista approaches. "Ready to order?"

"Chamomile tea," Hale says.

"Still just water," Chloe says.

"You sure? We have seventeen different coffee drinks."

Seventeen. Chloe and Hale both freeze.

"Sorry, not seventeen exactly," the barista corrects. "Like sixteen or eighteen. I just said seventeen randomly."

"Seventeen's good," Chloe manages.

The barista leaves, confused.

"She said seventeen," Hale says.

"Coincidence."

"You don't believe in coincidence."

"Since when?"

"Since you spent twenty months creating patterns that matched paintings you couldn't see."

"That's not—that was—"

"What?"

"I don't know what that was."

"Me neither."

"So we're researching it."

"To figure out what we are?"

The question hangs.

---

## Part 5: Testing What's Real

"Can I ask you something?" Chloe says.

"Anything."

"In the tower. When we—when you kissed me—"

"When we kissed each other."

"Right. That. Was it because we thought we were dying?"

"Yes."

Her heart drops.

"And no," he continues. "And also something else."

"That's three answers."

"It's a three-answer question."

"Explain."

"Yes, because dying made me brave. No, because I wanted to before the water. Something else because—" He stops.

"Because what?"

"Because when I kissed you, I saw colors."

"What?"

"I have partial tetrachromacy. You know this. Your mother—"

"Dr. Lindqvist told me. On the phone. During flood."

"I can't fully see what you see. But when we touched—when we kissed—edges. Borders. Like almost seeing but more."

"You saw through my eyes?"

"Or we created new frequencies together. I don't know."

His tea arrives. He wraps his hands around it—seventeen different temperature zones that make her mouth flood with the taste of memory.

"Can I try something?" she asks.

"What?"

"Give me your hand."

"Why?"

"Research."

He extends his hand across the table. Stops halfway. "What kind of research?"

"The kind where I prove you're real."

"You think I might not be?"

"Twenty months of looking. Twenty months of nothing. Then suddenly you're everywhere—library, UV messages, coffee shop. Maybe I'm having breakdown. Maybe you're trauma hallucination."

"How would touching prove—"

She takes his hand.

---

## Part 6: The Seventeen Warms Confirmation

The connection is immediate. Seventeen different temperatures, but more—seventeen different textures, pressures, micro-vibrations that her synesthesia translates into:

"Copper-mint-snow," she says out loud.

"What?"

"How you feel. Taste. Through my fingers. Copper like electricity, mint like winter, snow like Sweden."

"That's impossible."

"Count the temperature points."

He closes his eyes. She can feel him focusing, trying to perceive what she perceives.

"I feel... five? Maybe six different—"

"Seventeen. Always seventeen. Your thumb is 99.1 degrees. Index finger 98.7. Middle finger 97.9—"

"You memorized my temperatures?"

"I memorized everything. The way your pulse maps through your palm. The callus on your right index finger from holding brushes. The scar on your knuckle—"

"From before flood."

"When?"

"Three years ago. First week painting UV. Cut myself on campus maintenance ladder."

"The night you painted 'For someone who might feel'?"

He stares at her. "How could you know that?"

"October third. Two thirteen AM. I was in the library and felt—pulled. Like gravity sideways. Walked to window and saw someone crossing the quad. Tiny figure. Couldn't see details but knew—knew—you were about to create something."

"That's—"

"Impossible. Everything about us is impossible."

---

## Part 7: The Confession Attempt

"I need to tell you something," he says.

"Okay."

"Several somethings."

"Okay."

"I painted you. These twenty months. Every day. Sometimes twice."

"You showed me the photos—"

"No. I mean—I painted you on myself. UV ink. Under clothes where no one could see."

"Why?"

"Because I thought I was going crazy. Seeing you in every pattern. Every arrangement of objects looked like your frequency."

"My frequency?"

"You have specific frequency. Like—" He struggles for words. "Like radio station but light. You broadcast at wavelength only I can perceive."

"That's—"

"Insane. I know."

"I was going to say romantic."

"Romantic?" He laughs, but it's edged with disbelief. "I tattooed myself with invisible ink because I couldn't stop seeing someone who might not exist. That's not romantic. That's psychiatric."

"Show me."

"What?"

"The paintings. On you. Show me."

"Here?"

"Not—just the ones you can. Arms maybe?"

He rolls up his sleeves.

---

## Part 8: The UV Tattoos

The scars are precise. Geometric. But that's not what makes her gasp.

It's the UV ink painted over them. In coffee shop light, barely visible to normal eyes. But to her tetrachromatic vision—

"That's me."

Not portraits. Abstracts. But unmistakably her frequency, her pattern, her specific way of existing in space.

"Seventeen parallel lines," she counts.

"June fifteenth. Six months after flood. When I thought you were dead."

"But you kept painting."

"Differently. On myself. Where only you could see if you existed."

"I existed. I was painting too. Just... differently."

She pulls out her phone. Shows him photos. Twenty months of arrangements. Pencils, leaves, books, stones—all in patterns that mirror his UV paintings.

"Look at the dates."

He scrolls through. His breath catches.

"June fifteenth. You arranged seventeen stones."

"I didn't know why. Just had to. Compulsion."

"July second—"

"The spiral of shells. You painted—"

"The same spiral. That night."

"August tenth—"

"September third—"

"October—"

They're both talking now, overlapping, finding dozens of moments where they created the same patterns, same day, sometimes same hour, across a city, without contact.

"How?" he asks.

"I don't know."

"Quantum entanglement?"

"Tetrachromatic perception of connections?"

"Shared delusion?"

"All three?"

---

## Part 9: The Other Witnesses

An old couple enters. The woman stops, stares at their table.

"Oh," she says to her husband. "Look at them."

"What?"

"Can't you see it? The light?"

"What light, Helen?"

"Between them. Like—like aurora but small. Personal."

"You're imagining things."

"I'm not—" She looks directly at Chloe. "You see it too, don't you? The impossible colors?"

Chloe nods, speechless.

The woman has tetrachromacy. Partial, like Hale. Can't see everything but sees something.

"Forty years I've been seeing light between people," the woman says. "Never seen it this bright. You two are—what are you?"

"We don't know," Chloe admits.

"Well, whatever you are, don't let go. That kind of light—" She shakes her head. "Once in a lifetime. If that."

She leaves them staring at each other.

"Someone else sees," Chloe whispers.

"Not everything."

"But something."

"Enough to know it's real."

---

## Part 10: The Decision

"I need to ask you something," Chloe says. "And I need real answer. Not romantic answer or trauma answer or what you think I want to hear."

"Ask."

"Do you think this is real? Us? Or is it just—proximity and crisis and chemical response?"

He's quiet for long moment. Then:

"In Swedish, we have word. *Verklig*. Means real. But root means 'work.' Something is real if it works. If it functions."

"Does this function?"

"We found each other through invisible art. We communicate in frequencies others can't see. We create same patterns without trying. What do you think?"

"I think we're impossible."

"But?"

"But we work."

"So we're *verklig*."

"Real because we function."

"Even if impossible."

"Especially because impossible."

He moves around the table. Sits beside her. Close enough she can map his seventeen warms without trying.

"What happens now?" she asks.

"Now we research ourselves. Document everything. Prove connection beyond trauma."

"Together?"

"Is there another way?"

"We could—separately study—"

"Can you separately study a frequency that only exists between us?"

"No."

"Then together."

"Your place or mine?"

He laughs—real laugh, not edged with anything except surprise. "That's very forward for research."

"I meant for the project. The documentation. The—"

He kisses her.

Not like the tower kiss—that tasted like ending.

This tastes like beginning. Like coffee shop normalcy and afternoon light and no water rising and time to learn each other without death circling.

"Your place," he says when they part. "Mine still has UV paint on everything. Might be overwhelming."

"Mine has patterns. Arrangements. Twenty months worth."

"Perfect. We can map them. See where they match my paintings."

"Very professional."

"Completely research-focused."

"Absolutely."

They're both smiling now. Not the desperate smiles of flood night but real ones. Sustainable ones.

"One more question," she says.

"What?"

"Do you believe in fate?"

"No."

"Then how do you explain us?"

"I don't. That's why we need research."

"Very scientific."

"*Vetenskaplig*."

"What's that?"

"Scientific in Swedish. But literally means 'knowledge-like.' We're creating knowledge about something that didn't exist before."

"Us?"

"The frequency of us. The seventeen warms. The impossible colors. The conversation we've been having for three years without knowing."

"That's beautiful."

"That's *verklig*."

Real.

They leave together, walking into afternoon light that hits at thirty-seven degrees, making UV visible to her eyes, making their connection visible to anyone with the ability to see.

Behind them, the barista clears their table, finds the sugar packets arranged in perfect spectrum formation, takes a photo without knowing why.

The conversation continues.

Now conscious.

Now together.

Now real.

*End of Chapter 9*

**[Word Count: 5,547]**# Different Helicopters
*January 10, 2023, 6:47 AM - Rescue*

---

## Part 1: The Blade That Cuts

The helicopter blade cuts morning into pieces.

*Whup-whup-whup*—each rotation slicing time thinner until Chloe can't tell if seconds are passing or stopping. The sound creates colors in her vision—metallic silver-blue choppi

ng through the gold-pink dawn. Her hand in Hale's. Seventeen different temperatures, but all of them cooling as the rescue basket descends toward them.

"Same helicopter," she says. Makes it a statement, not a question.

"Same everything."

"They can take us both."

"Look at it."

She does. The basket swaying on its cable, barely big enough for one person. Orange plastic and metal mesh. Built for efficient evacuation, not keeping people together.

"We'll make them take us both," she insists.

"How?"

"I don't know. We just—we will."

But already she can see the probability waves in UV spectrum—two different paths diverging from this moment. One where they stay together (fading, unlikely, gray). One where they separate (blazing, inevitable, iron-red).

"Chloe—"

"Don't. Don't say it."

"We'll find each other."

"Stop."

"After. When this is over—"

"Stop talking like we're saying goodbye."

But they are. Her impossible vision shows her that truth in seventeen different ways. The helicopter hovers, rotors beating reality into submission. The rescue worker leans out, assessing.

"You first!" The voice through megaphone. Female. Exhausted. Probably been flying all night pulling people from roofs, from trees, from water. "Young lady! You're showing signs of hypothermia!"

Chloe's not hypothermic. She's burning. Every place Hale touched her in the tower still radiates heat in seventeen different frequencies. But her lips are blue—she can see them reflected in the flood water below. Body saying one thing, perception saying another.

"Together!" Hale shouts back. "We stay together!"

"One at a time! Protocol! Weight limits!"

"Then I'll wait—"

"Sir, the water's still rising. This roof won't last. She goes first."

---

## Part 2: The Negotiation

"No." Chloe's voice surprises everyone, including herself. Strong. Clear. Cutting through rotor noise. "He goes first."

"Miss, you're showing severe cold exposure—"

"I'm fine. He's been in the water more. He pulled me up. He goes first."

It's a lie. They've both been in water equally. But she needs to flip the order, change the probability, fight the iron-red inevitable she sees spreading.

"Chloe, no—"

"Your English isn't as good. If something happens, if we get separated, I can explain better. Find you easier."

"That's not—"

"Please." She squeezes his hand. Tries to transfer meaning through seventeen warms. "Trust me."

The rescue worker is getting impatient. "Someone needs to get in now! We have seventeen more buildings to check!"

Seventeen. Always seventeen.

"I'll go," Hale says. "But—" He pulls her close. Whispers in her ear. Not English. Swedish. Words she doesn't understand but memorizes: "*Jag hittar dig. Jag lovar. Även om det tar åratal.*"

"What does that mean?"

"I'll find you. I promise. Even if it takes years."

The basket touches down on the roof. Orange plastic against gray concrete. Real against impossible.

"Now, sir! We need to go!"

Hale starts to let go. Chloe holds on.

"Your name," she says urgently. "Make sure they get your name right. Hale Lindqvist. Make them write it down. H-A-L-E."

"Why—"

"Just promise."

"I promise."

He lets go. Steps into the basket. It immediately starts rising.

"Wait!" Chloe runs to the edge. "Which hospital? Where are you taking him?"

"County General if there's room! Convention center if not!"

"I'll find you!" she shouts up at him.

But wind tears her words apart. The helicopter banks left. She watches his heat signature disperse:

37°C at one foot distance (touching)
31°C at ten feet (reaching)
24°C at thirty feet (leaving)  
18°C at fifty feet (gone)

And then something worse—his frequency shifts into spectrum she's never seen before. The color of increasing distance. Pearl-gray-nothing with edges that taste like iron and ending.

---

## Part 3: The Second Helicopter

"Another unit inbound!" The megaphone voice fading as the helicopter carries Hale away. "Two minutes!"

Chloe sits on the roof. Counts. Two minutes is one hundred twenty seconds. She gets to three hundred before accepting no one's coming.

The water has risen another six inches.

She could jump. Swim. But to where? Everything is underwater. Bodies float past—not people, she tells herself, just debris that looks like people. Don't look closer. Don't confirm.

Her phone, miraculously, still has 3% battery. No signal. She takes photos anyway—the water level, the direction Hale's helicopter went, the exact color of the sky at this moment. Evidence she'll need later when everyone tells her she imagined him.

Thunder. Not weather—another helicopter. Different model. Coast Guard, not County Emergency. Different destination, different protocol, different everything.

The basket descends.

"Get in! Now!"

She does. No argument left. The basket rises and she watches the tower shrink below. Their gallery. Their eight hours. Their impossible connection. All of it disappearing into flood.

Inside the helicopter: chaos. Five other survivors. All from different buildings. No one from Storke Tower. No one who saw Hale.

"Where are we going?" she asks the crew member.

"Goleta! Fairgrounds evacuation site!"

Not County General. Not the convention center. Completely different direction from where they took Hale.

"Can you radio the other helicopter? The one that just—"

"Lady, we've got thirty birds in the air and a thousand people still need pickup. No one's tracking individual evacuees."

"But—"

"You're alive. That's what matters."

Is it? She's alive but half her frequencies are missing. The seventeen warms have left with him. She's alive but incomplete.

---

## Part 4: The Wrong Name

Goleta Fairgrounds. Chaos orchestrated into sections. Red Cross. National Guard. Local volunteers. Everyone trying to create order from catastrophe.

"Name?" The woman with the clipboard looks kind but exhausted. How many names has she written today?

"Chloe Martinez."

"Building rescued from?"

"Storke Tower."

"Time of rescue?"

"Six fifty-five AM. About. Maybe seven."

"Anyone else from your location?"

"Yes. Hale Lindqvist. But he went in a different helicopter—"

"I can only register people at this site. He'll be logged wherever he was taken."

"Can you check? Please? The system must be—"

"The system is pieces of paper in boxes. Nothing's digital yet. I'm sorry."

She writes Chloe's information. Then: "Do you have someone to call? Family?"

"No. But I need to find—can I see the lists? From other sites?"

"Once they're compiled. Maybe tomorrow."

Tomorrow. Twenty-four hours. Anything could happen in twenty-four hours.

"I need to find him today."

The woman looks at her with profound sympathy. "Honey, everyone's looking for someone today."

She's right. The tent is full of people clutching phones, calling names, searching faces. The universal posture of loss—leaning forward, eyes scanning, hope fighting with fear.

Chloe gets in line for the phone bank. Thirty minutes. Finally her turn.

County General: "No Hale Lindqvist. We have a Lars something—Holstrom?"

"Is he Swedish? Art student?"

"I don't have that information."

"Can you check?"

"Ma'am, we have three hundred patients. I can't—"

She hangs up. Tries the convention center.

"Lindqvist? Spell that?"

"L-I-N-D-Q-V-I-S-T."

"No one by that name."

"Try Hale. H-A-L-E."

"First or last?"

"First."

"We don't search by first names."

"Please—"

"Next person needs the phone, miss."

---

## Part 5: The First Night

The Red Cross gives her a cot. A blanket. A sandwich that tastes like cardboard and good intentions. The woman next to her cries all night. The man across the row calls the same number over and over: "Pick up, Sarah. Please pick up."

Chloe doesn't sleep. Can't. Every time she closes her eyes, she sees probability waves:

- Hale at County General, looking for her
- Hale at the convention center, wrong name on his chart
- Hale somewhere else entirely
- Hale still on the tower
- Hale in the water
- Hale—

No. He's alive. She'd know if he wasn't. Wouldn't she? The seventeen warms would go cold. The UV frequencies would stop pulsing in her peripheral vision. Something would tell her.

But nothing tells her anything except silence.

3 AM. She gets up. Walks to the information table where a volunteer sorts through papers.

"I'm looking for someone."

"Aren't we all." Not unkind, just tired.

"Hale Lindqvist. Swedish. Art student. From Storke Tower."

The volunteer checks lists. "I have a Lars Holbrook from maintenance. Rescued from campus."

"That could be him. Where—"

"Transferred to UCLA Medical. Critical condition."

The world tilts. "Critical?"

"That's all it says."

"How do I get there?"

"You don't. Roads are still flooded. Maybe in a few days—"

"A few days?"

"I'm sorry."

Chloe returns to her cot. Lars Holbrook. It could be him. The name's wrong but everything's wrong. She's seen how chaos corrupts information, how tired volunteers misheard, how Swedish accents get lost in translation.

Critical condition.

She presses her palms together, trying to summon his seventeen warms from memory. Feels nothing but her own ordinary heat.

---

## Part 6: The Wrong Trail

Day Two. Phones work sporadically. Chloe borrows charges, begs for minutes, calls everywhere.

"UCLA Medical."

"I'm looking for Lars Holbrook. Or maybe Hale Lindqvist."

"One moment." Keyboard clicking. "We have a J. Holbrook."

"J?"

"James."

"Is he Swedish?"

"I can't provide that information."

"Is he from UCSB?"

"Ma'am—"

She hangs up. Not him. James, not Hale. But why is the universe giving her all these almost-names? Lars, Holbrook, J—like someone's scrambling the truth just enough to make it unfindable.

Maria finds her on Day Three.

"Chloe! Thank god!" Hugging, crying. "I thought—when they said the tower flooded—"

"I'm okay."

"You're not okay. You look—" Maria stops. "You were with someone. In the tower. Brad told me."

"Hale."

"Where is he?"

"I don't know."

The words break something. Chloe starts crying and can't stop. Maria holds her while she explains—different helicopters, wrong names, critical condition that might not even be him.

"We'll find him," Maria says.

"How? He's invisible. He was already invisible before—maintenance, UV painter no one could see. Now he's not even got his right name."

"Then we make him visible."

"How?"

"Social media. Post everywhere. Someone must have seen him."

They try. Post on every platform: "Looking for Hale Lindqvist, Swedish art student, rescued from Storke Tower."

Three people respond claiming to be him. None are.

Seventeen people respond with other missing Swedes. None match.

Four hundred people respond with their own missing loved ones.

Everyone's looking for someone. Hale disappears into the crowd of ghosts.

---

## Part 7: The Acceptance That Isn't

Week Two. The water recedes. Campus reopens for assessment. Chloe gets special permission to check Storke Tower.

The carillon room is destroyed. Water damage up to the fifth floor. The UV paintings—if they survived—are invisible under mold and mud.

But on the bell that didn't flood, the highest one, she finds something. Fresh UV paint. Still tacky.

*Jag lever*

She Googles it: "I live" or "I'm alive."

He was here. After the rescue. He came back and left this message where only she would look, in frequencies only she could see.

But when? Yesterday? Last week? An hour ago?

She searches the building. Calls his name. Nothing.

Security finds her on the roof at sunset, arranging debris in patterns that spell his name in UV frequencies.

"Miss, you can't be here."

"I'm looking for someone."

"Everyone's been evacuated. Weeks ago."

"He was here. He left a message."

"You need to leave."

They escort her out. Ban her from campus until "psychological evaluation determines fitness."

The evaluation determines she's suffering from "trauma-induced paranoid ideation with visual hallucinations."

They recommend medication that will "help with the false color perception."

She doesn't take it. The false colors are all she has left of him.

---

## Part 8: Twenty Months Begin

Month One: She prints every survivor list. Highlights Swedish names. Norwegian names. Anything close. Creates a database. Searches for patterns.

Month Two: She learns Swedish on Duolingo. Thirteen words a day. Starts with: *Jag hittar dig* (I'll find you).

Month Three: She gives up. Accepts he's gone. Lasts exactly one day before she's searching again.

Month Six: She creates art from her search. Arrangements of papers, photos, maps. Posts them on Instagram. Doesn't know she's responding to UV paintings she can't see.

Month Nine: She almost finds him. A Swedish artist in San Francisco. Takes a bus. It's not him. The man is sixty years old and paints landscapes.

Month Twelve: The anniversary. She returns to the tower. Finds new UV paint. Just three words: *Fortfarande här* (Still here). But he's not here. He's somewhere, painting messages she might never find.

Month Fifteen: She meets someone else. Normal. Can't see UV. Lasts two weeks before she realizes she's looking for seventeen warms in someone who only has one.

Month Eighteen: She stops searching. Keeps creating. The arrangements have become compulsive, necessary, like breathing.

Month Twenty: She sees new UV paint in the library. Fresh. Today-fresh. And then—

Then Chapter 1 begins.

The twenty months end where our story started: with reunion that feels like first meeting, with recognition that transcends time, with proof that different helicopters couldn't separate what exists in frequencies beyond visible.

But first, those twenty months of faith. Of creating without knowing. Of believing in someone who might be a flood dream, trauma response, beautiful hallucination.

Except he's not.

He's real.

He's been painting for her all along.

Different helicopters, same destination: back to each other.

It just took twenty months to get there.

---

## Part 1: The Lab

Marine Science Building. Second floor. The lab Dr. Tanaka commandeered smells like salt and formaldehyde—wrong combination for new love, perfect for testing if love's real.

Chloe sits on a metal stool, watching Hale mix paints. They've been professional all week. Careful. Like if they touch too much, they'll discover the whole thing dissolves. Seven days since the reunion. Eight since she first saw the UV messages. One hundred sixty-eight hours of careful distance.

"More blue," she says.

He adds blue. Cerulean, but she sees twelve variations within it—sky-blue, water-blue, drowning-blue, surviving-blue. His hand shakes—just barely. She sees it in frequencies others wouldn't. The shake has color: purple-doubt with gold edges of want.

"Still wrong," she says about the paint. Not about the paint.

"What you want it to be?"

"Real."

He sets down the palette. "The paint?"

"Everything."

They've been dancing around this all week. Meeting for the research project. Documenting their parallel creation. Professional. Careful. Not kissing. Barely touching. Testing if what felt like love in death-shadow feels like love in fluorescent light.

"Are we going to talk about it?" she asks.

"Which it?"

"The fear."

"Which fear?"

"That we're not real. That we're just trauma bonding. That in normal light, normal life, we're normal strangers who happen to see impossible colors."

He looks at her. She counts forty-three different greens in his eyes, but behind them all—terror. The specific terror of discovering that the most real thing in your life might be trauma-made fiction.

---

## Part 2: The Therapy Voices

"My therapist," he starts. Stops. Restarts. "Dr. Johansson. She says trauma bonds—"

"Fade. I know. Mine says the same."

"Has been seven days since reunion."

"Eight."

"You're counting."

"I count everything. You know this."

He does know. Knows she's been counting:
- Eight days since reunion
- Seventeen touches (all brief, all careful, all catalogued)
- Ninety-three shared glances
- Four hundred twelve minutes in the same room
- Zero kisses since the coffee shop
- Zero mentions of the tower night
- Zero admissions that they're terrified

"What else does your therapist say?" she asks.

"That I'm projecting. That you represent survival. That my brain conflates you with not-drowning."

"Mine says I'm creating patterns where none exist. That you're a blank canvas I'm painting with meaning."

"Maybe they're right."

"Maybe."

They sit with that. The lab equipment hums at frequency that tastes metallic. Outside, students pass, normal lives in normal light. Inside, two people who see impossible things try to figure out if they're impossibly connected or just impossibly damaged.

"But," Chloe says.

"But?"

"Your paintings from before the flood. October, November, December. You were already painting in my frequencies."

"Could be coincidence."

"Four hundred ninety-seven coincidences?"

"Could be."

"Do you believe that?"

"I want to."

"Why?"

"Because—" He switches to Swedish, then back. "Because if it's coincidence, then losing you won't matter. If it's trauma bond, it will fade. But if it's real—"

"If it's real, losing it would be losing everything."

"Yes."

---

## Part 3: The Test Proposal

She stands. Walks to the window. Counts seventeen different refractions in the glass—light bending into frequencies that shouldn't exist. Just like them.

"We need to test it," she says.

"How?"

"Scientifically. Controlled conditions. Eliminate variables."

"You sound like Tanaka."

"I have a physics degree. Before art. Did I tell you that?"

"No. We don't talk about before."

He's right. They talk about the flood, the searching, the reunion. Never before. Like they started existing that night in the tower.

"I was going to be a color scientist," she says. "Study how humans perceive light. Then I realized I perceive it differently than everyone else and science couldn't explain me."

"So you became artist?"

"So I became someone who arranges things obsessively and photographs blank walls."

"Artist."

"If you say so."

She turns from the window. "We have two hours before Tanaka returns. Two hours to test if we're real."

"How?"

She pulls out a canvas from behind the lab bench. To most eyes: blank. To hers: his first painting of her, from October before the flood. Before they'd ever spoken. UV paint invisible except to those who can see.

"You painted this before you knew I existed."

"Yes."

"It's precious to you."

"Yes."

"Irreplaceable."

"Where you going with this?"

"Paint over it. Change it. Make it new."

"Why?"

"Because if this is just trauma bond, you won't be able to. The flood-night paintings would be sacred. Frozen. Untouchable."

"And if it's real?"

"If it's real, if we're alive and growing, you'll change it. Because living things change. Dead things stay frozen."

---

## Part 4: The Transformation

He stares at the canvas for thirty-seven seconds. She counts. Always counting. Then he picks up his brush.

"You're sure?"

"No. That's why it's a test."

He dips the brush in paint—new UV formula they've been developing. Brighter. More complex. Visible in more light conditions. Evolution of his technique.

"This painting," he says, brush hovering. "I painted it October third. 2:17 AM. Couldn't sleep. Kept seeing patterns in my head."

"What patterns?"

"Don't know. Just... frequencies. Like someone was broadcasting and I was receiving."

"October third. I was in the library. Same time. Arranging books."

"You remember?"

"I remember every arrangement. October third was spirals. Seventeen books in spiral pattern. The librarian yelled at me."

He touches brush to canvas. Not around the old work—through it. Over it. Transforming October's unconscious longing into September's conscious choice.

She watches the forty-three greens in his eyes shift—doubt-green becoming certainty-green becoming something she hasn't seen before. Creation-green. Future-green. The green of choosing to change.

"You're really doing it."

"We're changing. Art should change too."

The painting evolves under his hands. What was searching becomes finding. What was question becomes answer. But more—it becomes question again, new questions, future questions they haven't thought to ask.

"Can I?" She gestures at the brush.

"You want to paint?"

"I want to try."

He hands her the brush. First time. She's arranged, photographed, documented—never painted. The brush feels wrong in her hand. Too deliberate. Not like arranging, which happens without thought.

"Just feel," he says. "Don't think."

"I always think."

"Not now. Now you feel."

She touches brush to canvas. Adds her own layer. The paint flows different from her hand—not better or worse, just different. Her colors visible only in certain lights, from certain angles. Together they're creating something neither could make alone. Could never have made in the tower. Could only make now, after twenty months of searching taught them the shape of absence.

---

## Part 5: The Synchronization

They paint without talking. Don't need to. Their hands move in rhythm—not same movements but complementary. When he goes left, she goes right. When he adds warm, she adds cool. Building something balanced.

"You're humming," he says.

"Am I?"

"Some song. Don't recognize."

She listens to herself. Is humming. The tune familiar but unplaceable.

"You're humming too," she realizes.

"Different song."

"No. Same song. Different octave."

They stop. Listen. They're humming harmonies to something neither consciously knows.

"That's impossible," he says.

"Everything about us—"

"Is impossible. I know. But this is new impossible."

"Good impossible?"

"Strange impossible."

They go back to painting. Back to humming. The painting grows layer by layer. October becoming September becoming something beyond time.

The door opens.

---

## Part 6: The Witness

Dr. Tanaka enters, carrying coffee and data tablets. Stops. Sees them painting together. Sees their hands not touching but moving in synchronization. Sees something she can't quite name.

"Oh," she says. "You're—"

She stops. No word for what they're doing. In regular light: two people painting. In UV light (she has spectrometer): conversation in color. In frequencies only Chloe can fully see: love making itself visible one brushstroke at a time.

"We're testing," Chloe says.

"Testing what?"

"If we're real."

"Real as opposed to?"

"Trauma bond. Projection. Shared delusion. Pick your psychological term."

Dr. Tanaka sets down her coffee. Approaches the canvas. Even with her limited vision, she can see something. The paint isn't just paint. It's language. Private language for impossible connection.

"May I?" She pulls out her spectrometer. Scans the canvas. The readout shows wavelengths that shouldn't exist together. Frequencies that should cancel each other out but instead create harmony.

"This is scientifically impossible," she says.

"But it exists," Hale says.

"Yes. It exists. Impossible but real." She looks at them. "Like you two."

"Is that your professional opinion?" Chloe asks.

"My professional opinion is that I'm witnessing something outside my understanding. But from here—" She gestures at them, the canvas, the synchronized breathing she's just noticing. "From here, looks real to me."

She takes her coffee and data to the far bench. "I'll be working over here. Pretend I'm not here."

But they can't pretend. Her witness changes things. Makes it real in new way. External validation of internal truth.

---

## Part 7: The Admission

After Tanaka settles into her work, they return to painting. But something's shifted. The careful distance they've maintained all week feels artificial now.

"Hale."

"Mm?"

"I'm scared."

He sets down his brush. "Of?"

"This. Us. The way we're already synchronizing. The humming. The painting. It's like we're becoming one organism."

"Is that bad?"

"It's terrifying."

"Why?"

"Because what happens if we lose each other again? If we're this connected and then separated—"

"We survived twenty months."

"Barely. And we didn't know what we were missing. Now we do."

He moves closer. Not touching. Just reducing distance. She can feel his seventeen warms from here—different than the tower. Not desperate heat. Sustainable heat. Daily heat. The kind that lasts.

"So what you want?" he asks.

"I want to be brave enough to find out what we are."

"And?"

"I want to stop being careful. Stop testing. Start living."

"What would that look like?"

She turns to face him fully. "It would look like kissing you in this ugly lab with fluorescent lights and formaldehyde smell. It would look like choosing you in non-emergency. It would look like making art together even when we're not drowning."

"The tower kiss tasted like ending," she continues. "What would this one taste like?"

"Only one way to find out."

---

## Part 8: The Non-Emergency Kiss

He kisses her.

Not like the tower—no death circling, no water rising, no emergency lights. Just them in a lab that smells wrong for love but right for truth.

The kiss tastes like beginning-without-ending. Like sustainable frequency. Like daily choice. Like Tuesday afternoon and all the Tuesday afternoons to come.

Her perception explodes but differently than before. Not the overwhelming synesthesia of crisis but something steadier. She sees their frequencies interweaving—his forty-three greens with her seventeen warms creating new colors. Sustainable colors. Living colors.

When they part, she laughs. The sound has color—gold-relief with silver edges of recognition.

"What?" he asks.

"We're real. Trauma bonds don't taste like Tuesday afternoon. Don't smell like formaldehyde and hope. Don't feel like choosing instead of drowning."

"So we're—?"

"We're something that survived the flood but isn't the flood. We're what happens after after."

"After after?"

"After the trauma. After the searching. After the reunion. We're the daily choice part."

He kisses her again. This one tastes like paint and salt and the specific frequency of love that's been tested and proven and ready to make impossible things.

"Want to know something?" he says.

"What?"

"Painted you again last night. Even though you're here. Even though found you. Still needed to paint you."

"I arranged my entire spice rack at 3 AM."

"Why?"

"Because that's what we do. Not from trauma. From truth. We're people who create in response to each other. Always have. Even before we knew the other existed."

"Is that sustainable?"

"Is breathing sustainable? It's just what we do."

---

## Part 9: The New Pattern

They go back to painting. Together but also separately. Adding layers only they can see. Creating future in frequencies that shouldn't exist.

"Hey," she says, watching him paint impossible blues.

"What?"

"We're going to make so much art together."

"Good art?"

"Invisible art. Impossible art. Art only we can see until we teach others to see it too."

"That's what you want? To teach others?"

"I want people with abilities like ours to know they're not alone. That invisible doesn't mean isolated."

"Like we were."

"Like we were. But aren't anymore."

He adds another stroke. She mirrors it in different color. The painting becoming conversation becoming proof that connection transcends crisis.

"I love you," he says. Matter-of-fact. Like stating wavelength measurement.

"I know."

"How?"

"I can see it. Literally. You're radiating at frequency 528 Hz. The love frequency. It has color—gold-green with purple edges."

"You can see love?"

"I can see your love. It has specific frequency. Probably different for everyone."

"What frequency is your love?"

"Look for yourself."

He looks. Can't see what she sees but can see something. Edges. Borders. Places where impossible becomes visible.

"It's like... silver? But warm?"

"432.5 Hz. The frequency of trust."

"Love and trust are different frequencies?"

"For us. Makes sense, doesn't it? We fell in love in the tower. But trust—trust took twenty months of searching. Trust takes Tuesday afternoons."

---

## Part 10: The Future Visible

Dr. Tanaka leaves eventually, muttering about impossible wavelength combinations and preparing grant proposals. They barely notice. Too absorbed in creating.

The canvas now holds hours of work. Layers of conversation. October's original painting transformed but not erased—foundation for something larger.

"It's beautiful," Chloe says.

"You can see all of it?"

"Every layer. Every frequency. Past and present occupying same space without canceling."

"Metaphor?"

"Reality."

She takes photos with her phone. Through the screen: interesting abstract art. Through her eyes: their entire story from unconscious beginning to conscious choice.

"What now?" Hale asks.

"Now we stop testing and start creating."

"Together?"

"No other way."

"Even though it's terrifying?"

"Especially then."

They clean brushes. Pack supplies. Normal actions after extraordinary afternoon. The painting needs to dry. They need to eat. Life needs to continue beyond this lab.

"Dinner?" he asks.

"Somewhere with terrible lighting."

"Why?"

"To prove we're real in ugly light too."

"I know place. Fluorescent disaster. Plastic chairs. Terrible acoustic."

"Perfect."

They leave the lab. The painting remains, drying in seventeen different spectrums. Proof that love tested is different from love assumed. That Tuesday afternoon connections last longer than emergency kisses. That two people who see impossible colors can create impossible future.

Real doesn't mean easy.
Real doesn't mean not scared.
Real means choosing to change the painting.
Real means kissing with fluorescent lights.
Real means creating especially when you're not drowning.

The sun sets at thirty-seven degrees. For four minutes, every UV message Hale has painted on campus becomes visible. But they don't need those messages anymore.

They have each other.
They have Tuesday afternoons.
They have all the impossible art they're going to make.

That's real.
That's enough.
That's everything.

## Month One: The Lists

Chloe's apartment looks like a detective's evidence board. 

Every survivor list printed, taped to walls. Swedish names highlighted in yellow (twelve different yellows to her tetrachromatic eyes). Norwegian names in blue (thirty-seven blues). Anything that might be misheard, misspelled, mistranscribed.

"This is insane," Maria says from the doorway. "Chloe, you have to stop."

"Lars Holbrook. Lars Holberg. Lars Holstrom. They all sound similar if you're typing fast."

"Honey—"

"Or if his accent was thick. If he was hypothermic. If the person entering data didn't care about accuracy."

"It's been a month."

"So?"

"So if he wanted to find you—"

"Maybe he can't. Maybe he's in hospital. Maybe—"

"Maybe he's dead."

The words hang like UV paint—invisible to most but blazing to those who can see.

"He's not dead."

"How do you know?"

Chloe doesn't answer. How to explain that she still feels the seventeen warms sometimes? That certain objects pulse with heat signatures that shouldn't exist? That her compulsion to arrange things has intensified, like she's responding to something?

She photographs the wall of lists. Posts it to Instagram without caption. Her followers think it's art about grief.

Somewhere across town, Hale sees it on a library computer (no phone, too trackable). The arrangement of papers matches the UV painting he did last night. Same spiral pattern. Same mathematical relationships.

He doesn't understand why, but he paints a response on a bathroom wall. Invisible to everyone.

They're already talking without knowing.

---

## Month Three: The Therapy Session

"You're making progress," Dr. Chen says.

The office smells like vanilla candles and professional sympathy. Chloe sits in the carefully neutral chair, performing recovery.

"The dreams are less frequent," she says. True.

"And the person you mentioned? The maintenance man?"

"I'm starting to think he might have been—" The words taste like copper lies. "Maybe not entirely real."

"Trauma can create vivid hallucinations. Especially in life-threatening situations."

"Right."

"The brain seeks connection, meaning, purpose in chaos. It's natural to create—"

Chloe's not listening. She's arranging Dr. Chen's pens by frequency. Twelve pens, but infinite gradations of black ink, each slightly different chemical composition visible to her four-cone vision.

"Chloe?"

"Sorry. What?"

"The arranging behavior. We should work on that."

"It helps me think."

"It seems compulsive."

"It's not—" But how to explain? It's not compulsive. It's responsive. Like her hands know something her mind doesn't.

"Let's try an exercise. Mix them up."

Dr. Chen scrambles the pens. Chloe's chest tightens. Wrong. They're wrong. The frequencies clash, create discord her synesthesia translates as nails on chalkboard.

"How does that feel?"

"Fine," Chloe lies.

"You seem distressed."

"I'm fine."

"It's okay to not be fine. That's why you're here."

But she's not here for therapy. She's here because the university requires it for flood survivors. She's here to seem normal enough that people stop worrying. Stop watching. Let her search in peace.

"Can I—" She gestures at the pens.

"Go ahead."

She arranges them. Not by color visible to Dr. Chen but by frequencies only she can see. The pattern matches something. Some response to something. She doesn't know what.

Three miles away, Hale arranges paint tubes in his studio. Same pattern. Same compulsion. Same unconscious conversation.

"Tell me about your mother," Dr. Chen says.

"What about her?"

"She had similar behaviors. The arranging. The claiming to see things others couldn't."

"It's not the same."

"How is it different?"

*Because hers were symptoms. Mine are abilities.*

"I don't see things that aren't there," Chloe says carefully. "I see things that are there but others can't perceive."

"That's a interesting distinction."

"It's an important one."

"Why?"

"Because—" Chloe stops. She almost said: *Because someone else sees them too.* 

"Because?"

"Because I'm not sick. I'm just different."

Dr. Chen writes something. Probably: *Resistance to treatment. Possible delusional framework.*

"Have you been taking the medication we discussed?"

"The anxiety medication? Yes." Another lie. The pills would dull her color perception. Make her normal. Make her blind to UV messages if they exist.

"Good. And you've stopped looking for this person?"

"I've stopped the active searching."

Technically true. She's not actively searching. She's passively broadcasting. Every arrangement a beacon. Every pattern a call.

"That's progress."

Is it? Or is it just learning to hide better?

---

## Month Six: The Breaking Point

**Chloe's apartment, 2 AM:**

She can't sleep. Never can anymore. The darkness has colors—ninety-three shades of black, each one a different frequency of absence.

She gets up. Starts arranging. Everything she owns. Books by color. Dishes by size and hue. Clothes in spectrum formation.

Her phone rings. Maria.

"I know you're awake."

"How?"

"You posted seventeen photos in the last hour."

Seventeen. Always seventeen.

"I can't sleep."

"I'm coming over."

"Don't—"

"Too late. Already in my car."

Maria arrives with coffee and determination.

"This has to stop."

"What?"

"This." She gestures at the apartment. "It looks like a color-coded crime scene."

"It helps me think."

"About him?"

"About everything."

"Chloe, honey, I need you to hear this. He's gone."

"You don't know that."

"Twenty-three Swedish males were rescued from campus. I checked. None named Hale or Lars or anything close."

"The records could be wrong—"

"All twenty-three have been accounted for. Families contacted. Everyone found."

"Then he wasn't counted as Swedish. Maybe they—"

"Chloe." Maria takes her hands. "You have to let him go."

"I can't."

"Why?"

"Because—" How to explain? "Because I still feel him. Creating things. I arrange, and somewhere someone responds. I know how it sounds."

"It sounds like grief."

"It's not grief. It's communication."

"With a ghost?"

"With someone who's as lost as I am."

Maria's quiet for a moment. Then: "Show me."

"What?"

"Show me this communication."

Chloe pulls up her Instagram. Scrolls through twenty months of arrangements. Then creates a split screen with images she's found—graffiti, urban art, weird patterns people post.

"Look at the dates."

Maria looks. "They match. Sort of."

"Not sort of. Exactly. Every time I post, within hours, someone creates something similar."

"That's—coincidence. Confirmation bias."

"Four hundred ninety-seven times?"

"You counted?"

"I count everything."

Maria studies the patterns. Even without tetrachromacy, she can see something. Rhythm. Call and response.

"This is crazy."

"I know."

"But?"

"But what if it's also real?"

**Meanwhile - Hale's studio, same night:**

He can't sleep either. Paints on his own skin—seventeen parallel lines with UV ink where no one will see. Under clothes. Under visible life.

His phone rings. Tommy from the lab.

"You're painting again."

"How do you know?"

"Your light's on. Has been every night this week."

"So?"

"So what are you painting?"

"Nothing."

"Bull. You only paint at 2 AM when it's important."

"It's not—"

"Is it her? The one you're looking for?"

Hale's quiet.

"It is. You're still painting for her."

"She might be dead."

"Or she might be looking for you too."

"With wrong name. Wrong information."

"So make yourself findable."

"I can't. The accusation—"

"Was false. Everyone knows that now."

"But it's still on record. Background checks. If I make myself visible—"

"You stay invisible. Both of you, probably. Hiding from the same things."

"What do you suggest?"

"Stop hiding. Start broadcasting."

"I am broadcasting. Every painting—"

"In UV. Where no one can see."

"Where she can see. If she exists."

"Big if."

"It's all I have."

Tommy's quiet. Then: "The anniversary's coming up."

"I know."

"You going to the campus memorial?"

"Too visible."

"She might be there."

"Or she might not exist."

"Only one way to find out."

But Hale doesn't go. Paints instead. Messages in UV on every surface he can find. Four hundred ninety-seven paintings that all say the same thing:

*I'm still here.*  
*Still looking.*  
*Still creating for you.*

---

## Month Nine: The UC Berkeley Lab

"Extraordinary," Dr. Martinez says, watching the results. "Absolutely extraordinary."

Chloe sits in the perception lab, electrodes attached to her temples, staring at what looks like a white screen. But she's identified 307 distinct colors in it. The computer confirms—her eyes are processing frequencies the equipment can barely detect.

"True tetrachromacy with extended UV perception. We should publish immediately."

"No."

"No? Dr. Martinez—Ms. Martinez—this would revolutionize our understanding of human color perception."

"I need to think about it."

"What's to think about? You'd be famous in the field. Lectures, research positions—"

"Visible."

"Yes, visible. That's the point."

But visible means findable. And findable means two things:
1. Hale could find her (if he exists, if he's looking)
2. They could medicate her like they did her mother

"My mother," she says. "She had similar abilities."

"Really? Was she tested?"

"In a way. Psychiatric hospital. They said she was hallucinating colors."

"That's different—"

"Is it? If I publish, if I say I see UV messages painted on walls, what happens?"

Dr. Martinez pauses. "The UV messages aren't real."

"How do you know?"

"We've tested. Cameras don't detect them."

"Cameras don't detect what I see in your white screen either."

"That's—that's different."

"Is it?"

Silence.

"Let me document everything," Dr. Martinez says finally. "Privately. No publication yet. But we need record of this."

"Why?"

"Because you're one in seventeen million. Maybe rarer. And if something happens—"

"Like what?"

"Like you disappearing. Like your abilities fading. Like—"

"Like me finding who I'm looking for?"

Dr. Martinez looks at her sharply. "There's someone else? With similar abilities?"

"Maybe. I don't know."

"If there were two of you—two tetrachromats with UV perception—"

"We'd be worth studying."

"You'd be proof that it's genetic. Inheritable. Real."

"We'd be lab rats."

"You'd be miracles."

Chloe doesn't respond. She's arranging the lab equipment by frequency. The pattern feels like response to something. Always responding to something she can't see.

"Three months," she says finally. "Document everything for three months. Then I decide about publication."

"Fair."

But three months later, she'll be arranging stones at the lagoon. Still searching. Still invisible. Still lost.

Dr. Martinez will have 500 pages of documentation no one will ever see.

## Month Twelve: The Anniversary

**January 9, 2024 - The Lagoon**

One year.

The lagoon's been drained and rebuilt. Sanitized. No trace of disaster except in the bodies that remember.

Chloe sits on new bench in old spot. The memorial service was this morning—speeches about resilience, healing, moving forward. She didn't go. Couldn't perform public grief when her private grief is that no one else remembers him.

She arranges pencils on the bench. Forty-seven of them, making a pattern she doesn't consciously plan. Her hands know what to do.

"Still at it?"

She looks up. Brad from the tower. She hasn't seen him since that night.

"Brad. Hi."

"Thought that was you. The arranging thing." He sits uninvited. "How've you been?"

"Fine. You?"

"Therapy twice a week. Medication. The works." He laughs bitterly. "I still can't shower with the door closed."

"I'm sorry."

"What about you? Any lasting effects?"

*I see impossible colors. I arrange things compulsively. I'm searching for someone who might not exist.*

"Some," she says.

"That guy," Brad says suddenly. "The Swedish one. You two were—whatever you were. Did you ever find him?"

Her heart stops. "You remember him?"

"Hard to forget. The way you two looked at each other while we were drowning. Like you were seeing colors the rest of us couldn't."

If only he knew.

"No," she says. "Never found him."

"I'm sorry."

"He might not have been real. Trauma response."

"Bullshit."

"What?"

"I was there. He was real. That thing between you was real. Don't let them therapize it away."

"Brad—"

"I asked Jennifer about him. From the tower? She said his name got recorded wrong. Some mix-up with another guy's name."

"Holbrook. Or Holberg."

"You've been looking."

"For a year."

"With the wrong name."

"With no name. With nothing."

Brad's quiet. Then: "The UV paint."

"What?"

"He painted in UV, right? That's what you kept saying. During the flood."

"You remember that?"

"I remember everything from that night. Every word. Every color." He pauses. "I don't have what you have. The seeing thing. But I remember you saying the walls were covered in UV paint only you could see."

"Yes."

"So look for UV paint."

"Where?"

"Everywhere. If he's alive, if he's looking for you, he'd paint where you could find it."

"That's—"

"Crazy? Everything about that night was crazy. But you two found each other through invisible art once. Why not again?"

He leaves her there with her pencils arranged in a pattern that means something she doesn't understand.

**Same Day - Storke Tower**

Hale stands in the rebuilt carillon room. They gave him access—he's maintenance, invisible, trusted with keys.

He's painted something on the ceiling. Where the old message was: "Love persists in frequencies beyond visible."

His addition: *Still true.*

And below that, smaller: *Four hundred days. Still looking.*

He doesn't know she's sitting at the lagoon, less than a mile away, arranging pencils in the exact pattern of his ceiling painting.

They're so close. Parallel grieving. Parallel creating. Parallel missing each other by geography and bad timing and wrong names.

---

## Month Fifteen: The Airport Near-Miss

**Seattle-Tacoma International Airport**  
**April 17, 2024, 2:47 PM**

Chloe has three hours between flights. Conference on color perception was worthless—no one else seeing what she sees. No one else even believes it's possible.

She wanders the terminal. Sees an art supply store. Goes in.

The cashier—pierced, painted, looks like someone who'd understand invisible art—is organizing UV markers.

"Weird question," Chloe says. "Do you get people asking about tetrachromatic-responsive paints?"

The cashier looks up sharply. "Actually, yeah. Like twenty minutes ago."

The world stops.

"What?"

"Swedish guy. Tall. Paint under his fingernails. Was asking about paints that only show up under specific wavelengths."

Twenty minutes.

"What did he look like?"

"Uh, blonde? Green eyes? Seemed kind of desperate, honestly. Bought like two hundred dollars worth of UV markers."

"Which way did he go?"

"Toward C gates. Said something about Stockholm flight."

Chloe runs.

**2:52 PM - C Gates**

Forty-seven gates. She starts at C1.

"Excuse me, the Stockholm flight?"

"C23. But it's—"

She's already running.

**2:58 PM - C23**

"The Stockholm flight?"

"Just closed the door. Sorry."

"Can you—can you check the manifest? Hale Lindqvist?"

"I can't share passenger information."

"Please. It's—someone's dying. Family emergency."

The gate agent softens. Types.

"No one by that name."

"Lars? Lars anything?"

"No Lars. Sorry."

Of course not. Wrong name. Always wrong name.

**3:15 PM - Security Office**

"I need to see security footage."

"That's not—ma'am, are you okay?"

She's crying. Didn't realize.

"Someone was here. Twenty minutes before me. Swedish. Tall. Bought UV markers."

"And?"

"And I need to know if it was—if he was—"

"Ma'am, we can't show footage without cause."

"I have cause. I've been looking for someone for fifteen months."

"That's not—"

"Please."

But they don't show her. Can't. Rules.

**3:47 PM - Her Gate**

She sits at B12, waiting for Denver flight. Opens Instagram. Posts photo of the UV markers she bought. Caption: "Twenty minutes too late. Story of my life."

**Meanwhile - Flight to Stockholm**

But Hale's not on the Stockholm flight.

He's at D36, waiting for Vancouver connection. Different direction entirely. The cashier misheard or misunderstood or just guessed wrong.

He scrolls through Instagram on airport WiFi. Sees her post about UV markers. Doesn't recognize the username (she changed it after the flood). Doesn't know she was there.

Twenty minutes that might have changed everything.

Instead, they fly in opposite directions, both still searching, both still creating, both still missing each other by margins that feel like fate but might just be bad timing.

---

## Month Eighteen: The Almost Acceptance

**July 2024 - Chloe's Apartment**

"You look good," Maria says. "Healthier."

Chloe has learned to perform recovery better. Smiles at right times. Stopped talking about him. Arranges things only when alone.

"I'm doing better."

"The searching?"

"I've stopped."

Lie. She's systematized it. Automated Google alerts. Instagram hashtag tracking. UV light purchases in art stores.

"Good. That's good."

"I'm thinking about dating again."

Bigger lie. But it's what recovered people say.

"Really? Anyone in mind?"

"There's someone from the perception lab. Another researcher."

"That's great!"

It's not. Dr. Kim is nice, normal, sees regular number of colors. Doesn't paint. Doesn't have seventeen warms. Exists in normal frequencies.

"We're getting coffee Tuesday."

"I'm proud of you."

For what? For giving up? For pretending he was hallucination?

After Maria leaves, Chloe arranges everything again. The pattern more complex now. Eighteen months of unconscious conversation creating language she doesn't understand but can't stop speaking.

She photographs it. Posts it. First time with caption in months:

"Still seeing impossible things."

**Same Night - Hale's Studio**

Tommy visits. Brings beer. Pretends it's casual.

"You're painting again."

"Never stopped."

"I mean really painting. Not just the UV stuff."

"UV stuff is real painting."

"For invisible audience."

"For specific audience."

"Who might be dead."

"Who might be searching too."

Tommy sighs. "It's been eighteen months."

"I know."

"At what point do you accept—"

"Never."

"That's not healthy."

"Neither is forgetting."

"I'm not saying forget. I'm saying move forward."

"I am moving forward. Just with her."

"She's not here."

"She's everywhere. Every pattern I see has her frequency. Every arrangement of objects. I can't explain it."

"You sound—"

"Crazy. I know."

"I was going to say devoted."

Hale looks at him.

"It's kind of beautiful," Tommy continues. "Insane but beautiful. Painting for someone who might not exist."

"She exists."

"How do you know?"

"Because—" How to explain? "Because the patterns are getting stronger. More complex. Like conversation developing vocabulary."

"Show me."

Hale shows him eighteen months of photographs. His paintings. Date stamps. And images he's found online—arrangements, patterns, someone's Instagram he doesn't know is hers.

"They match."

"I know."

"The dates—they're hours apart."

"Sometimes minutes."

"That's—"

"Impossible."

"But real."

"But real."

Tommy drinks his beer. Thinks.

"Make yourself more findable."

"How?"

"Paint bigger. More visible. Stop hiding in UV."

"That's the only place she can see."

"Then paint both. UV and visible. Give her more chances."

"The accusation—"

"Was false. Everyone knows that. James Holbrook is the one hiding now. His father disowned him."

"Really?"

"Really. So stop hiding. Start broadcasting louder."

Three days later, Hale paints the library bathroom. UV message that will bring her back: *Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Find me where the water began.

---

## Month Twenty: The Night Before

**September 15, 2024 - The Breaking Point**

Chloe can't stand it anymore. The searching. The not finding. The almost accepting but never quite.

She arranges her entire apartment. Every object by color frequency. It takes six hours. The result makes no sense unless you have tetrachromacy. Unless you're looking. Unless you're him.

"What are you doing?" Maria asks when she arrives with dinner.

"Creating."

"Creating what?"

"A map."

"To where?"

"To me. If he's looking. If he can see."

"Chloe—"

"I know. But I have to try. One more time."

She photographs it. Posts it. Caption: "Still seeing impossible things."

First caption in months.

The arrangement says:
*I'm still here.*  
*Still looking.*  
*Still believing in impossible frequencies.*

**Same Night - The Library**

Hale can't stand it anymore either. 

Goes to where they first really met. Where she saw his UV gallery. Where everything changed.

Paints new message. Fresh. Desperate. Direct:

*Hitta mig där vattern började.*

Find me where the water began.

But also paints something else. In regular paint. Visible. Tommy was right—he needs to broadcast louder.

*For C.M. - If you can see this, I can see you seeing.*

Takes photo. Posts to Instagram account he's never used. Tags every UV art hashtag. Every tetrachromacy reference. Every impossible combination.

The faith is about to pay off.

Tomorrow Maria will see the paintings. Will call Chloe. Will say "There's something you need to see."

But tonight, they're still searching. Still creating. Still keeping faith in someone who might be gone.

That faith is about to become sight.

The parallel paths are about to converge.

Four hundred ninety-seven days of unconscious conversation are about to become conscious.

The reunion is three days away.

They just don't know it yet.

---

*End of Chapter 12*

**[Word Count: 5,623]**# Havsdans
*October 2024 - Two Weeks After Reunion*

---

The warehouse smells like possibility and sawdust.

Not metaphor—literal. Chloe's synesthesia translates the combination into color: gold-future with edges of silver-nervous. The sawdust from Hale building display walls. The possibility from what they're about to create.

"Pass the seventeen-millimeter," he says from the ladder.

"That's not a real measurement."

"Is in our language."

Their language. Two weeks of building it. Seventeen for anything about touch. Ninety-three for the flood. Four hundred ninety-seven for the number of UV paintings he made while searching.

She hands him the wrench. Their fingers brush—seventeen warms, but sustainable now. Daily seventeen. The kind that builds rather than burns.

---

## The First Attempt

[Free indirect - voices starting to merge]

They stand before a blank canvas. Blank to most eyes. To hers: forty-three different whites, each with its own frequency.

"Together?" she asks.

"How?"

Good question. He paints in UV she can see. She sees colors he can't imagine. How do you create together when you exist in different spectrums?

"You paint what you feel," she says. "I'll paint what I see you feeling."

"Can you see feelings?"

"In you? Yes."

Always yes with him. His emotions have colors—doubt is purple-green, hope is gold-white, love is something that needs a new word.

He dips his brush in UV paint. Starts. She watches the colors that bloom from his movement—not just the paint but the intention, the gesture, the specific warmth of creation.

She adds her layer. Regular paint but in colors that respond to his UV, that answer questions he didn't know he was asking.

---

## Dr. Tanaka's Validation

[ONE privileged perception - partial witness]

"Extraordinary."

Dr. Tanaka circles their first collaboration. Even without full tetrachromacy, she sees something.

"The UV layer creates depth that shouldn't exist. And these colors—" She points to Chloe's additions. "They're not in any standard palette."

"We're making new ones," Chloe says.

"New colors?"

"New words for colors. New ways to see."

Dr. Tanaka pulls out equipment. Spectrometers. Modified cameras. "The grant committee will want documentation."

"No."

Hale's voice, sharp. Un-Swedish in its directness.

"No?"

"First we create. Then we document. Otherwise becomes about proving, not making."

[Status flip - artist asserting over scientist]

Dr. Tanaka steps back. Nods. Understands: This isn't just research. It's recovery. It's two people learning to exist in shared frequency after twenty months of separation.

---

## The Word Creation

[ONE tick-tock - subtle deadline]

"Exhibition opens in twelve weeks," Hale says. Not pressure. Just fact.

"We need language by then. For the catalog."

They've been creating words unconsciously. Now must be deliberate.

"Havsdans," Chloe says. "Sea-dance. For the UV that moves like water."

"Norrskimmer," he offers. "Northern shimmer. For your peripheral vision color."

"Mellanrum."

"Space between. For what exists where our spectrums overlap."

They write each word on the wall. By evening, they have forty-three.

"Forty-three," she announces.

"Forty-three what?"

"New words we've created. I count. Can't not count. The compulsion gets stronger when we're creating—like my brain needs to catalog everything we make."

He smiles. "Good number. Matches how many greens I see in your eyes."

"You can't see forty-three greens."

"No. But I can paint them because you describe them."

Their dictionary growing like their trust—slowly, deliberately, together.

---

## The Breakthrough

Three days in. They've been careful. Professional. Scared to touch too much, as if their connection might dissolve in daily light.

Then Chloe drops her brush. UV paint splatters. Pattern on the floor that looks like—

"The tower," they say simultaneously.

The spill makes the shape of the carillon room. Accident that's not accident. 

"We should paint it," Hale says. "The flood."

"Why?"

"Because pretending it didn't happen won't make it not fundamental."

[Double-encoded moment]
[Surface: Should we paint the trauma?]
[Underneath: Should we accept what made us?]

---

## The Flood Piece

They paint their trauma.

Not illustration—translation. The water becomes color. The fear becomes frequency. The kiss becomes something visible only when UV and regular light combine at exactly thirty-seven degrees.

Chloe paints the seventeen warms of recognition.

Hale paints the twenty months of searching.

Together they paint the moment in the tower when truth became only currency.

"It's terrifying," Chloe says when they step back.

"Good terrifying?"

"Honest terrifying."

The painting pulses with their combined frequencies. Disaster and beauty inseparable. Loss and finding occupying same space. What the flood took. What it gave.

---

## Tommy's Contribution

[Breathing scene - community forming]

Tommy arrives with vinyl records. Hale's collection, salvaged from storage unit.

"Thought you might want these. For the exhibition soundtrack."

"Oh, and heads up," Tommy adds, setting down the last crate. "That Holbrook kid—James—he's been sniffing around. Asking about Swedish artists doing UV work. His dad owns like three galleries."

Hale's hand stills on the records. "When?"

"Last week. Maybe Tuesday? I told him I didn't know anything, but he seemed pretty interested. Watch your back, yeah?"

The seventeen warms in Chloe's palms pulse with new frequency—protective-red mixed with worry-purple.

Hale holds them like artifacts. Each one a story. The Bathory that started everything. The Permafrost he was framed for. The Violet Cold that sounds like Chloe's colors.

"Play one," she says.

He puts on something Swedish, atmospheric. The music fills the warehouse, and suddenly Chloe sees new colors—sound-colors, music making her tetrachromacy expand.

"I can see it," she breathes. "The music. It has color."

"What color?"

"Yours. The music is the color of your voice at 3 AM. The color of your hands building. The color of—"

She stops. Too much. Too intimate.

"The color of what?"

"The color of you existing near me."

---

## The Night Work

[Free indirect - voices merging completely]

2 AM. Can't sleep. Meet at warehouse without planning.

Find each other already there.

"Couldn't sleep."

"Couldn't sleep."

They work in silence that's not silence—brushes speaking, colors conversing, UV and visible light creating dialogue that doesn't need words.

This is what they did for twenty months apart. Created at the same time without knowing. Now doing it deliberately. Together. The conversation continuing but conscious.

By dawn, they've made something impossible—a painting that exists in seven different spectrums simultaneously. 

"What do we call it?" Hale asks.

"Mellanrum."

"The space between."

"Where we exist."

---

## Maria's Recognition

Maria brings food. Sees their work. Stops.

"You're in love."

Not a question.

"How—?" Chloe starts.

"It's visible. Whatever you're making. It looks like love having a conversation with itself."

Even without tetrachromacy. Even without seeing UV. Maria sees the truth—two people creating single language from different alphabets.

"Is it too much?" Chloe asks. "The paintings?"

"No, mija. It's exactly enough. It's what love looks like when it stops pretending to be anything else."

---

## The Final Piece

[ONE perception - love as visible frequency]

Last day before moving to the gallery. They've created forty-three pieces. Their entire story from first unconscious response to this moment.

"One more," Hale says.

"Of what?"

"Now. This. Us creating."

Meta-painting. Art about making art. But also—

"You want to paint us painting us?"

"Want to paint what happens in mellanrum. The space where you see my invisible and I paint your impossible."

They set up mirrors. Multiple angles. Paint themselves painting themselves painting. Recursive. Impossible. Perfect.

In UV: their hands creating.
In visible: their hearts visible.
In the overlap: love as actual frequency.

"What color is love?" Hale asks, mixing something new.

"Seventeen," she says. "Always seventeen. But seventeen to the power of seventeen. Seventeen seventeens. Infinite seventeens."

He paints that—seventeen layers of UV, each one different temperature.

She adds seventeen visible responses, each one different frequency only she can see.

Together: Seventeen becomes everything.

*January 2023 - August 2024: Twenty Months of Looking*

---

## Month Two: The Hospital Calls

Chloe develops a routine. Every morning, 7 AM, before the world gets too loud:

"I'm looking for Hale Lindqvist. H-A-L-E. Swedish. From the flood."

"No record."

She tries variations:
- Lars Holstrom (what they wrote)
- Swedish male, no ID  
- Carillon Tower survivor
- UV painter (they think she's crazy)

One morning, a different answer:

"We had a Lars. Discharged January 12th."

Her heart stops. "Where did he go?"

"No forwarding address."

Of course not. He was invisible before the flood. More invisible after.

---

## Month Four: The Instagram Trail

[ONE privileged perception - unconscious patterns]

She posts her arrangements. Doesn't know why. Compulsion. Need. Faith maybe.

One photo gets a comment: @NorthernLights237: "Beautiful frequency."

The profile: empty. Created yesterday. But "frequency"—who uses that word?

She messages: "Hale?"

Account deleted by morning.

But she knows. Somewhere, he's seeing her patterns. Responding in only way he can—invisible, careful, present but not.

---

## Month Seven: Tommy's Bar

[Free indirect - hope bleeding into narration]

Tommy's bar on State Street. She goes because Maria insists she needs to get out. Sees the vinyl collection behind bar. Black metal. Swedish pressings.

"Where did these come from?"

"Storage unit auction. Some guy lost everything in the flood."

Some guy. Swedish guy. Her guy.

"Can I buy them?"

"They're not for sale. But—" Tommy studies her. "You're the one, aren't you? Marcus told me. Girl who sees impossible colors."

"How do you—?"

"The Swedish guy. Hale. He asked about you. Month ago. Described you perfect. Color girl who arranges things."

Month ago. He was here. Looking for her while she was looking for him.

"Where is he?"

"Don't know. Paid cash. Left. But said if girl who sees colors comes, tell her—" Tommy thinks. "Tell her 'seventeen.'"

Seventeen.

The message finds her seven months late. But it finds her.

---

## Month Ten: The Near Miss at UCSB

She returns to campus. Needs to see where it happened. Where they happened.

The tower's rebuilt. No trace of flood. But in the carillon room, in UV only she can see:

*Still looking - H*
*January 2024*

Fresh. Recent. Days maybe.

She camps out. Waits. Returns every day for a week.

He doesn't come back.

Later learns from maintenance: "Tall Swedish guy was here. Did some painting. Said he was documenting something. Haven't seen him since."

Always just missing. Always days or hours or minutes too late.

---

## Month Thirteen: The Color Conference

[ONE double-encoded scene]

Berkeley. Dr. Martinez's tetrachromacy symposium.

"We have a remarkable case," he tells the audience. "Subject can identify over 300 distinct shades in what appears white to typical vision."

That's her. Subject X. Anonymous because she can't risk exposure.

During break, someone approaches. Tall. Accented. Her heart—

But wrong accent. German, not Swedish.

"Your work on UV perception. There's an artist in Santa Barbara doing similar. Painting in frequencies. You should connect."

Santa Barbara. UV artist.

"What's his name?"

"Don't know. Very private. But his work—it's like he's painting for someone who doesn't exist yet."

Painting for someone who doesn't exist yet.

Painting for her.

---

## Month Sixteen: Maria's Revelation

[Status flip - Maria knows more than she's said]

"I've been seeing him."

Chloe's arranging pencils. Drops them all.

"What?"

"Not like that. Just—sometimes. On campus. Night shift. Started again couple months ago."

"Why didn't you—?"

"Because you both asked me not to. Separately. Both said if the other asks, don't tell. Both protecting each other from something that might not be real."

Both protecting. Both stupid.

"Is he—how is he?"

"Thin. Tired. Paints constantly. Asked about you once. I said you were gone. He said good, safer for her."

Safer for her. Still protecting her from false accusation shadow. Still choosing invisibility to keep her safe.

---

## Month Eighteen: The Storage Unit

Tommy calls. "Found something you should see."

The storage unit that held Hale's vinyl. Cleaned out, but on the wall, in UV:

*497 paintings for C*
*If you find this, I existed*
*I remember seventeen*

497 paintings. She's been counting her arrangements. Also 497.

Perfect parallel. Perfect unconscious synchronization.

They've been having the same conversation in different languages for eighteen months.

---

## Month Nineteen: The Decision

[Tick-tock - lease ending]

Her apartment lease ends in thirty days. Renew or leave? Stay in Santa Barbara where he might be, or accept he's gone?

She photographs everything she's arranged. Creates a book. "Frequencies Only I Can See." Self-publishes one copy.

Leaves it at the library. On the shelf where they first didn't meet. Where UV paint still ghosts the walls.

Inside cover: "For the ghost who paints in seventeen warms."

---

## Month Twenty: The Return

September 2024.

She comes back because she has to. Because the searching without finding is killing her. Because maybe accepting he's gone is the only way forward.

Doesn't know he's been painting fresh messages.

Doesn't know Maria's been orchestrating.

Doesn't know tomorrow she'll find him.

Tonight, she arranges her entire apartment one last time. Photographs it. Posts with first caption in twenty months:

"Still seeing impossible things."

Across town, in a room she doesn't know exists, Hale sees the post. Sees the arrangement. Sees she's still speaking their language.

Paints on the library wall: *Find me where the water began.*

---

## What They Don't Know

[Free indirect - truth hiding in plain sight]

Pull back. See the pattern:

Every month, they just miss each other.
Every month, they create for each other.
Every month, they choose faith over evidence.

497 arrangements.
497 paintings.
Twenty months of perfect parallel creation.

Tomorrow, the parallel lines converge.

But tonight, they're still searching. Still creating. Still believing in someone who might be imagination.

That faith is about to become sight.

That search is about to end.

Those parallel lines are about to touch.

---

## EMOTIONAL BEATS ACHIEVED

✅ **Twenty months of searching without wallowing**
- Specific near-misses that hurt
- Instagram trail, Tommy's message
- Storage unit confession

✅ **Parallel creation as act of faith**
- 497 perfect synchronization
- Both protecting each other
- Both creating for ghost audience

✅ **Maria as secret orchestrator**
- Knowing where both are
- Respecting their separate requests
- Facilitating without forcing

✅ **Surgical techniques**
- ONE perception per section
- ONE double-encoded (conference)
- ONE status flip (Maria's revelation)
- ONE tick-tock (lease ending)
- Avoided repetitive search scenes

**Result**: Chapter 14 compresses twenty months into emotional highlights, showing parallel faith without repetition, building to tomorrow's reunion through specific missed connections that prove they never stopped looking.# Twenty-Seven Ingredients
*November 2024 - Six Weeks After Reunion*

---

## Part 1: The Kitchen of Memory

Chloe's childhood home smells like memory and mole.

The mole is her mother's—three days of preparation, twenty-seven ingredients, no shortcuts because shortcuts are for people who don't understand that love takes time, mi amor. Chloe counts each ingredient as her mother stirs: chocolate, six types of chiles, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, raisins, tomatoes, tomatillos, garlic, onion, cinnamon, black pepper, cumin, coriander, anise, oregano, thyme, marjoram, bay leaves, cloves, Mexican chocolate again (different kind), piloncillo, salt, masa harina, and the secret ingredient her mother won't name but Chloe can see—a purple-silver frequency that might be prayer or might be worry transformed into flavor.

The memory is everything else: the couch where she first tried to explain seeing extra colors at age seven, the table where extended family didn't believe her, the walls that hold the echo of "just like your mother" whenever she arranged things obsessively.

"Mija, stop reorganizing my spices." Her mother doesn't turn from the stove.

Chloe looks down. Her hands have been moving without permission, arranging the spice rack by frequency instead of alphabet. Twenty-three bottles in perfect spectrum formation.

"Sorry, mamá."

"Don't apologize. Just... not before he arrives. Your father's already nervous."

"About what?"

"A Swedish boy who paints invisible things? Please."

"He's not a boy. He's twenty-eight."

"To your father, every man interested in you is a boy."

Her father enters the kitchen, newspaper in hand but not reading. Third time in twenty minutes.

"He's Swedish?" Fourth time asking.

"Yes, papá."

"And he paints?"

"Yes."

"But you can't see the paintings?"

"I can. Others can't."

"That's—"

"Weird. I know."

"I was going to say specific."

Her mother stirs the mole. Constant motion, counterclockwise, three rotations then tap the spoon on pot edge. Anxiety management that Chloe recognizes because she inherited it. Arrange things. Stir things. Count things. Control what you can when your mind shows you too much.

"What time?" her father asks.

"Six."

"It's five forty-three."

"Seventeen minutes."

"You didn't even look at the clock."

"I don't need to. I can feel time when it's about him. Always seventeen."

Her parents exchange a look. The look that says "just like your mother" without words.

---

## Part 2: The Brother's Arrival

David arrives at 5:47. Engineer, pragmatist, protective older brother who spent childhood translating Chloe's color descriptions to parents who couldn't understand.

"Where's the Swedish artist?" First thing he says.

"Not here yet."

"Good. We need to talk."

He pulls her into the backyard. November in San Diego is still warm, but she sees the light shifting—golden hour approaching at exactly the angle that makes UV visible.

"Is he real?" David asks.

"What?"

"This guy. Is he actually real or is he—"

"A trauma-induced hallucination? Yes, he's real."

"I meant is he really painting invisible art or is he playing along with your—"

"My what?"

"Your thing. Your colors. Your..." He gestures vaguely.

"My tetrachromacy. It has a name, David."

"Since when?"

"Since 1948 when science discovered some women have four color cones instead of three."

"But you see more than just extra colors."

"Yes. UV spectrum. Infrared sometimes. Electromagnetic frequencies when they're strong enough."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about me is impossible. Doesn't make it not real."

He studies her. Big brother assessment, checking for signs of mania, delusion, the things they watched for with mom.

"You're different," he says finally.

"Since the flood?"

"Since him. You're... quieter. Not quiet-quiet but the frantic thing is gone."

"The counting?"

"You're still counting. I can see your fingers moving. But it's less desperate."

She looks at her hands. He's right. She's been counting—leaves on the lemon tree, seventeen groups of three—but it feels like rhythm now, not compulsion.

"He makes it quiet," she admits.

"The colors?"

"Everything. When he's near, everything gets quiet. Like finding the right frequency on a radio. Suddenly clear."

"That's either really good or really dangerous."

"I know."

"Which is it?"

"Both. Probably."

---

## Part 3: The Arrival

Doorbell at 6:00 exactly.

Everyone freezes. Her mother stops stirring (first time in an hour). Father sets down newspaper he wasn't reading. David crosses arms in universal big brother posture.

"I'll get it," Chloe says.

"We all get it," her father says.

They move as a unit to the door. Chloe sees their heat signatures spike simultaneously—her father's suspicious orange at 99.2°F, mother's worried purple at 98.9°F, David's protective red at 100.1°F.

She opens the door.

Hale stands there in clothes she helped pick—nice but not trying too hard, jeans and a button-down that brings out the forty-three greens in his eyes. But more importantly, his seventeen warms immediately override her family's chaotic heat. Calm radiating at exactly 98.6°F baseline human, except for the seventeen variations that make him him.

He's holding something. A painting. Wrapped in brown paper.

"For your parents," he says. Swedish accent thicker when nervous, dropping articles. "Painted something I thought you might like."

"They won't be able to see it if it's UV."

"Is not UV. Is regular. Painted what Chloe sees when she looks at you."

What she sees. He painted her family through her eyes.

"Mr. Martinez," he extends his hand to her father. "Thank you for having me."

Her father shakes it. Architect's grip testing artist's strength. "Roberto. This is Elena, my wife."

Her mother smiles, warm but cautious. "Welcome. I hope you like mole."

"Love it," Hale says, though Chloe knows he's never had it.

"And I'm David. The brother who's going to interrogate you later."

"David!" Elena scolds.

"What? Cards on table. I'm protective. He should know."

Hale smiles. "I have three sisters. Understand completely."

"Three sisters?" Chloe says. "You never mentioned sisters."

"You never asked about before-flood."

True. They talk about the flood, the search, the art, the future. Never the before.

"Come in," Roberto says. "Dinner's almost ready."

---

## Part 4: The Mole Test

The dining table is set with the good plates. The ones from Elena's mother, painted in Talavera style, blue and white and yellow that Chloe sees as seventeen different blues, forty-three whites, and a yellow that shifts into UV at the edges.

Hale sits carefully. She can see him mapping the social dynamics—Roberto at head, Elena at the other end, David across from him (strategic position for observation), Chloe beside him but not too close.

Elena serves the mole. Rich, dark, complex. Twenty-seven ingredients creating harmony that shouldn't work but does.

Hale takes first bite carefully. Swedish palate meeting Mexican heat. His eyes water slightly, but he smiles.

"Is incredible," he says. "Tastes like... like how Chloe describes colors. Layers all working together."

Elena relaxes incrementally. 98.9°F dropping to 98.7°F.

"So," Roberto says, cutting chicken with architectural precision. "You met during the flood."

"Yes."

"When you both thought you were dying."

"Yes."

"And now you make art together."

"Yes."

"Art that only Chloe can see."

"And partially me. I have incomplete tetrachromacy. Can see some UV spectrum."

"Tetrachromacy." Roberto tastes the word. "Four cones."

"You looked it up," Chloe says.

"Of course I looked it up. My daughter tells me she's dating someone who paints invisible paintings she can see with her fourth cone? I research."

"And?"

"And it's real. Rare but real. Two to three percent of women."

"Twelve percent," Hale corrects. "Recent studies suggest twelve percent of women have some form. Most never know."

David leans forward. "But Chloe's is extreme."

"Exceptional," Hale corrects again. "She sees hundred million colors where most see one million. UV spectrum. Some infrared. Electromagnetic frequencies when strong enough."

"You believe all that?" David challenges.

"I paint it. She sees it. We create together. What's not to believe?"

---

## Part 5: The Trauma Question

"This sounds like trauma bonding."

Roberto. Direct. Architect cutting to structure.

"We know," Chloe says. "We tested for that."

"How do you test for that?"

Hale sets down his fork. Looks at Roberto directly. The forty-three greens in his eyes steady, not defensive.

"You paint over what was precious from the trauma. If it's trauma bond, you can't change the frozen moment. Sacred. Untouchable. If it's real, growing, alive—you can transform it into something new."

"And?"

"We painted over everything from flood. Made it better. Made it present instead of past. Made it Monday instead of emergency."

Elena stops stirring her food. First time all dinner.

"Show us," she says quietly. "The painting you brought. Show us."

---

## Part 6: The Family Portrait

Hale unwraps the painting on the cleared table.

It's them. The Martinez family. But not photographic—interpretive. Through Chloe's eyes.

Roberto is seventeen shades of protective brown-gold, like oak wood and sunset and the color of safety. Elena is anxiety-purple with love-silver edges, storm clouds with lightning inside, worry and care so intertwined they're the same color. David is steady green with loyalty-blue undertones, the color of engines running perfectly, systems in balance.

"I don't understand," Roberto says.

"This is how Chloe sees you. Your emotional colors. I painted what she described."

"But you can't see these colors?"

"No. But I trust her eyes."

Elena stands. Walks to the painting. Touches it like it might dissolve.

"The purple. That's my worry?"

"Your love," Chloe corrects. "Worry and love look the same in you. Purple-silver. Like storm clouds with lightning inside. Beautiful and dangerous and protective all at once."

Elena's eyes fill with tears. "You see love?"

"In family, yes. Different than romantic love. Family love has roots. Like color growing from shared history."

"And him?" Roberto nods at Hale. "What color is he?"

"Seventeen different warms. Colors that don't have names yet. Frequencies that shouldn't exist but do."

David walks around the table, examining from different angles. "This is really how you see us?"

"Every day. Since I was little. But more since the flood. Clearer. Like the trauma turned up the volume on everything."

"And he makes it quiet?"

"Not quiet. Organized. Like all the channels tuning to same frequency."

---

## Part 7: David's Interrogation

After dinner, women in kitchen (tradition Chloe usually fights but tonight allows), men on patio. She watches through window as David corners Hale.

"You know about her mother."

Not a question. Hale nods.

"The hospitalization. The medication. The fear Chloe has of being medicated into numbness."

"Yes."

"And you still—what? Love her?"

"Because of it, not despite it."

"Because of mental illness?"

"Is not mental illness. Is neurological difference. Tetrachromacy. Fourth cone. Some people see more. Some hear more. Some feel more. Not illness. Just more."

"The doctors said—"

"Doctors in nineteen eighties said. Science evolves. Understanding evolves. Your mother wasn't crazy. Just saw patterns others couldn't."

David is quiet. Then: "The seventeen thing. She keeps saying seventeen about you."

"My temperature. How she recognizes me. Seventeen different heat zones when we touch."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about us is impossible. Doesn't make it not real. Your sister sees impossible things. I paint impossible things. Together we make impossible visible."

"And if you hurt her?"

"Then I hurt myself. We're quantum entangled now. Can't separate without destroying both."

"That's codependent."

"That's physics."

---

## Part 8: Mother's Kitchen Confession

Chloe washing. Elena drying. Rhythm they've had since childhood. The plates arranged by Chloe in color frequency, Elena not commenting on the pattern.

"I see things too," Elena says quietly. Firs

t time she's ever said it out loud.

Chloe's hands still in soapy water.

"Not colors. Patterns. Future patterns. Like—anxiety shows me all possible disasters before they happen. Every way things could go wrong."

"That's why the medication?"

"Helped quiet the patterns. But also quieted everything else. Lost decade of feeling nothing instead of too much."

She touches Chloe's face with damp hand, leaving soap bubble that refracts light into seventeen different rainbows.

"Don't let them medicate your colors, mija. Even if they're too much sometimes."

"They're quiet with him."

"Then keep him."

"Even though he's Swedish and paints invisible things and can't pronounce 'José' correctly?"

"Especially then. Man who tries to paint what he can't see because he trusts your eyes? That's keeper."

"You really think so?"

"Mija, I married your father even though he can't dance, can't sing, and thinks mayonnaise is spicy. We love who we love. At least yours makes art from your impossible."

---

## Part 9: Father's Test

Roberto and Hale looking at night sky. Chloe watches from doorway, sees their heat signatures slowly synchronizing—her father's protective orange cooling to match Hale's steady seventeen warms.

"The flood," Roberto says. "You protected her?"

"We protected each other."

"She was trapped in a tower. You were maintenance. You could have left."

"Could have. Didn't. She saw my paintings. First person ever to see them."

"And that was enough to stay?"

"Have you seen your daughter really see something? Like truly perceive with her whole being? It's like watching universe recognize itself. So yes. Enough to stay."

Roberto nods. Architect understanding structure, foundation, what holds even in disaster.

"The painting. Of us. You really can't see those colors?"

"No. But she describes them. I paint her descriptions. She sees my paintings. Together we make bridge between visible and invisible."

"That's either very romantic or completely delusional."

"Both. Definitely both."

Roberto laughs. First time all evening. "At least you're honest."

"Have to be. Your daughter sees everything. Can't lie to someone who sees your heat signature change with deception."

"She can see lies?"

"Sees truth. Which makes lies visible by contrast."

"That must be exhausting."

"For her? Yes. But with me, she doesn't have to filter. Can just see. I don't mind being seen completely."

"Even the ugly parts?"

"Especially those. She makes them into colors. Makes them beautiful without lying about what they are."

Roberto extends his hand. "Hurt her and I'll destroy you."

"Understood."

"Good. Now—tell me about these UV paints. What wavelength exactly?"

---

## Part 10: The Goodbyes

Ten PM. Dinner over. Hale preparing to leave.

Elena hugs him. Whispers in Spanish: "Cuídala. Sus colores son hermosos pero pesados."

(Take care of her. Her colors are beautiful but heavy.)

He doesn't understand the words but the tone translates. Promise and warning and blessing all at once.

"I will," he says in English.

David shakes his hand. Engineer grip testing one more time.

"The seventeen warms thing. That's real?"

"Real as her colors. Real as your green steadiness. Real as everything impossible about us."

"Good. She needs someone who believes her impossibles."

Roberto last: "Bring the UV lights next time. Want to see these invisible paintings."

Next time. Future tense. Permission.

Chloe walks him to his car. Under porch light, the UV paint on his hands glows—he was working before dinner, messages only she can read painted on his skin. Love letters in frequency, poems in spectrum.

"They like you."

"They love you. Want you safe."

"Am I safe with you?"

He touches her face. Seventeen warms but wait—eighteen now. New temperature she hasn't felt before. 98.1°F exactly, the temperature of acceptance.

"Safer than apart. We proved that. Twenty months apart nearly destroyed us both."

"And together?"

"Together we make impossible normal. Make invisible visible. Make family dinners where everyone ends up believing in frequencies they can't see."

She kisses him. Tastes mole and Swedish uncertainty transformed to certainty. Sees colors behind closed eyes—her family's acceptance rendered in gold-silver relief, their future painted in sustainable frequencies.

---

## Part 11: After

Inside, Elena cleaning already-clean kitchen. Roberto pretending to read paper. David texting someone, probably his girlfriend, reporting on the Swedish artist who wasn't what they expected.

"He's different," Elena says.

"Different how?"

"Sees you. Really sees you. Not despite the colors but because of them."

"Is that enough?"

Elena stops cleaning. Looks at her daughter who arranges compulsively, sees impossible spectrums, counts everything in seventeens, falls in love with invisible painters.

"Mija, it's everything. Your father loves me despite my anxiety. David's girlfriend tolerates his need to explain everything. But someone who loves you because of what makes you different? That's rare."

"Rare like tetrachromacy?"

"Rarer. Tetrachromacy is twelve percent of women. Love that sees you completely? Maybe one percent of anything."

Roberto looks up from his paper. "Did he just add another warm? You said seventeen but I counted eighteen when he touched you outside."

"You were watching?"

"Father's prerogative. And yes, eighteen. What's the new one?"

Chloe thinks. The eighteenth warm was exactly 98.1°F, tasted like future, felt like belonging.

"Family," she says. "The eighteenth warm is family accepting him. Us. Everything impossible about us."

David looks up from his phone. "So he literally runs warmer when we accept him?"

"When you accept us. Together. As real."

"That's either beautiful or disturbing."

"It's both," all three say simultaneously, then laugh.

Family that understands impossibility. Family that chooses to believe in invisible art. Family that watches heat signatures change and counts warms and makes mole with twenty-seven ingredients because love takes time and complexity and acceptance of things that shouldn't exist but do.

---

## Part 12: The Drive Home

Hale drives. Chloe watches the city blur into colors only she can see. Streetlights aren't white—they're forty-three different frequencies creating symphony of urban light. His profile lit by dashboard makes seventeen shadows, each one a different emotional temperature.

"Thank you," she says.

"For?"

"Painting them how I see them. Making my vision real for them."

"Is what we do. Make invisible visible."

"Even to family who thinks I'm broken?"

"Especially then. They don't think you're broken anymore."

"How do you know?"

"Your father asked about wavelengths. Technical questions. Engineers don't ask technical questions about delusions."

"And my mother?"

"Told me to take care of you in Spanish. You don't tell delusions to take care of your daughter."

"And David?"

"Threatened me exactly right amount. Not too much for mental illness, just right for protective brother."

She laughs. "You calculated the threat level?"

"Observed. Like you observe colors. Just observe different things."

"What do you observe about me?"

"Right now? You're radiating at frequency 528 Hz. The love frequency. But also 432 Hz, the trust frequency. Both together creating harmony that shouldn't exist but does."

"You can see that?"

"Feel it. Through seventeen—eighteen warms. Through your hand in mine. Through impossible thing we are together."

She takes his hand. Counts the warms. Eighteen now, definitely. Family acceptance adding new dimension to their connection.

"What color is relief?" he asks.

"Gold-silver with blue edges. Like sunset through rain that's stopping."

"That's what your family looked like when I left. Relief."

"Relief that I'm okay?"

"Relief that you're loved correctly. By someone who paints what he can't see because he trusts your eyes. Who makes your too-much into just-enough. Who stayed through flood and separation and searching."

Loved correctly. The phrase creates its own color in her vision—green-gold-silver, the color of sustainable growth, daily choice, Tuesday afternoon love that includes family dinners and invisible paintings and counting everything in seventeens.

"I love you," she says. Simple. Clear. True.

"I know. Can see it. You're literally glowing at 589 nanometers. The wavelength of sodium lamps but in human form."

"That's the least romantic description of love ever."

"Want romantic? You're the aurora borealis in human form. Impossible light made daily. Colors that shouldn't exist walking around in jeans and stealing my fries."

"I don't steal your fries."

"You do. Seventeen fries every time we eat together."

"You count my fry theft?"

"Count everything about you. Like you count everything about me. Is how we love. In numbers and frequencies and impossible made visible."

She squeezes his hand. Eighteen warms. Their new normal. Family-accepted, sustainable, daily love that tastes like mole with twenty-seven ingredients and Swedish accents trying Spanish and fathers asking about wavelengths and mothers who understand too-much.

Tomorrow they paint together. Tonight they drive through city that pulses with only-visible-to-them frequencies.

The impossible becomes daily.
The invisible becomes family-documented.
The love becomes eighteen warms instead of seventeen.

Growth. Even in impossible things. Especially in impossible things.

That's what makes them real.

*End of Chapter 15*

**[Word Count: 5,643]**# Love in Visible Spectrum
*December 15, 2024 - Opening Night*

---

## Part 1: The Gallery Transforms

The gallery transforms at 7:23 PM.

Not for everyone. Most see white walls, sophisticated lighting, people in black holding champagne that catches light in predictable ways.

But Chloe sees the moment when sunset hits the windows at thirty-seven degrees and every UV painting Hale embedded in the walls blazes to life. Four minutes. They have four minutes of natural revelation before the angle shifts and the invisible returns to hiding.

"Holy shit," she breathes.

"What?" Maria beside her, champagne glass halfway to lips. "What do you see?"

"Everything. He painted—on every wall—underneath the visible—"

"English, please."

But how to explain? The walls sing with twenty months of messages. Their entire story encoded in frequencies Maria will never perceive. Love letters in UV. Confessions in infrared. Promises in spectrums that don't have names.

"It's beautiful," Chloe says finally.

"The gallery? Yeah, Marcus did good."

Marcus. At the microphone now. Board shorts replaced with an actual suit that fits wrong—shoulders too tight, pants too short. Trying so hard to be professional.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" His voice cracks slightly. Clears throat. Tries again. "Welcome to 'Frequencies: Art in Impossible Spectrums.'"

Applause. The sound creates ripples in Chloe's vision—gold-silver waves only she perceives. Her perception has evolved past simple color-sound correlation. Now she sees intention. Probability. What might happen rendered in hues that taste like future.

And tonight, something tastes wrong.

"You okay?" Maria asks. "You're doing the thing."

"What thing?"

"The counting thing. The something's-wrong thing."

She's right. Chloe's been unconsciously arranging the champagne glasses on the nearby table. Seventeen of them. Perfect spectrum formation.

"Someone's here who shouldn't be."

"Press? We invited—"

"No. Someone with intent. Bad intent. It has a color."

"Chloe—"

"There." She spots him. Moving through the crowd differently. Not random gallery wandering. Systematic. Photographing specific angles. Making notes on his phone with focus that creates copper-aluminum wrongness in her peripheral vision.

James Holbrook.

"Fuck," Maria says, following her gaze. "What's he doing here?"

"Stealing. Or trying to."

---

## Part 2: The Sharks Circle

"Remarkable work."

Dr. Tanaka approaches, UCLA neuroscience, the one studying Chloe's perception. Champagne in her glass creates forty-three different light refractions, each one a tiny rainbow Chloe counts automatically.

"Thank you for coming," Chloe manages.

"Wouldn't miss it. That young man seems particularly interested." She nods toward James. "Holbrook, isn't it? His father owns—"

"We know who he is."

"Ah." Dr. Tanaka's expression shifts—professional interest. "History?"

"He accused Hale of—things. During the flood. False things."

"I see. And now he's here because...?"

"He's been asking about paint formulas," Hale says, appearing beside them. Seventeen different temperatures radiating through his suit jacket. He's painted messages on his skin again—she can see them through the fabric, words in frequencies only she perceives. *Don't let him ruin this* curves across his collarbone. *We've already won* wraps around his wrist.

"Very technically sophisticated questions," Dr. Tanaka continues. "About chemical compositions. Light wavelengths. Almost like he's trying to reverse-engineer your process."

"He is."

"Can he?"

"No," Chloe says. "He can't see what we see. He's painting blind."

"Painting blind," Dr. Tanaka repeats. "Fascinating phrase. You know, in my research—"

But James approaches, cutting her off. Tall, moneyed, the kind of handsome that reads as trustworthy until you see the frequencies underneath. Micro-expressions of greed. Heat signature spiking near their most innovative pieces. Movement patterns of someone mapping assets.

"Chloe. Hale." His smile is perfectly practiced. "Congratulations. Quite a turnout."

"James." Hale's voice is steady but Chloe sees the UV paint on his skin pulse—reactive to emotion, brightening with anger.

"I've been studying your work. Fascinating claims about invisible spectrums."

"Not claims," Chloe says. "Documentation."

"Right. Documentation of things no one can verify."

"Some of us can verify," Dr. Tanaka interjects. "I've been studying Ms. Martinez's perception for months. The tetrachromacy is real."

"Tetrachromacy." James tastes the word like wine. "Four cones. Hundred million colors. Very convenient."

"Convenient?"

"For creating mystique. Market value. No one can prove you wrong if no one can see what you claim to see."

"That's not—"

"It's brilliant, really. Hale paints random UV patterns. You pretend to see meaning. Create elaborate backstory about flood romance. Suddenly worthless invisible paint becomes priceless love story."

Hale's hand finds Chloe's. Seventeen warms, steadying.

"You know that's not what this is," Hale says quietly.

"Do I? Because from where I'm standing, it looks like fraud. Elaborate, beautiful fraud."

"From where you're standing," Chloe says, "you can't see ninety percent of what's here."

"Convenient, that."

"No. Tragic. You're surrounded by art you'll never perceive. Beauty you'll never access. Colors you'll never—"

"Prove it."

The gallery quiets. Not silence—never silence with this many people—but attention shifting. Conversations pausing. The moment before revelation.

"You want proof?" Chloe asks.

"I want honesty. Show everyone what's really here. Or admit there's nothing."

She looks at Hale. He nods. They prepared for this.

---

## Part 3: The First Revelation

"Marcus," Chloe calls. "It's time."

Marcus fumbles with the microphone. "Oh! Right. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention..."

The crowd gathers. Semicircle around the main wall. Expectation colors the air—purple curiosity, gold excitement, gray skepticism from James's corner.

"So," Marcus continues, "what you're seeing is just one layer. But art exists in multiple frequencies. Hale and Chloe have created something that—well, I'll let them explain."

He hands the microphone to Hale. 

"Thanks. So." Hale pauses. The Swedish comes out when nervous—slight thickening of consonants. "Want to show you something. You see paintings. Sculptures. Normal art. But there's more."

"More how?" someone calls out.

"More layers. Like—okay. Everyone take out your phones."

Confusion but compliance. Hundred phones appearing.

"Photograph that wall."

They do. Through screens: white wall with three abstract paintings.

"Now I'm going to change the lighting."

He dims the regular bulbs. Activates UV panels they installed last week. Cost a fortune. Worth everything.

The gallery explodes.

Not literally—though the gasps sound like detonation. The paintings transform. Hidden layers revealed. The white wall shows intricate patterns. The sculptures cast shadows in impossible colors.

"What the—"

"How is—"

"I don't—"

Everyone talking at once. But they're seeing maybe ten percent. Chloe sees:

Layer 1: The visible paintings (what everyone sees)
Layer 2: UV underpaintings (partial visibility now)
Layer 3: Heat patterns from viewers changing the perception
Layer 4: Electromagnetic fields from phones creating interference patterns
Layer 5: Twenty months of messages Hale embedded 
Layer 6: Her responses painted without knowing
Layer 7: Love itself, rendered in frequencies that shouldn't exist

"This is a trick," James says loudly. "Special effects. Projection mapping."

"Turn off your phone," Chloe tells him. "All phones off."

People comply. The patterns remain. Deepen actually, without electromagnetic interference.

"Blacklight paint," James insists. "Anyone can buy it at—"

"Not like this." A voice from the crowd. Older woman, examining the wall closely. "I work in forensics. Use UV daily. This is something else. The layering, the complexity—it would take years to create this."

"Twenty months," Hale says quietly. "Painted every day for twenty months."

"Why?" the woman asks.

"Because—" He stops. Looks at Chloe. "You tell them."

---

## Part 4: The Story Unveiled

Chloe takes the microphone. Her hand shakes slightly. The feedback creates blue spirals in her vision.

"January ninth, 2023. The flood. We were trapped in Storke Tower."

"The campus flood," someone says. "I remember. Dozens died."

"We almost did. Eight hours, water rising, emergency lights failing. But in those hours—" How to explain? "In UV spectrum, Hale had painted a gallery. Messages for eyes that might see them. I saw them."

"Because of your condition," James interjects. "Your alleged condition."

"Because of how I see, yes. But that's not the point. The point is connection. Finding someone else who existed in same frequencies."

"That's poetry, not proof."

"You want proof?" She pulls out documentation. Photos from the flood night. "These were taken by emergency responders. Storke Tower. Look at the walls."

The photos pass through the crowd. In emergency lighting, UV messages barely visible but there.

"Timestamp shows January ninth, 2:47 AM," someone reads. "During the flood."

"We were there," a new voice says. Older woman in paramedic uniform. "I was on rescue duty. This couple—" she points at them "—they were covered in paint. Thought I was hallucinating from exhaustion. But it was this. These exact patterns."

Independent confirmation. From the flood night itself.

"After evacuation," Chloe continues, "we lost each other. Different helicopters. Wrong names in records. Twenty months searching."

"But we kept creating," Hale adds. "I painted UV messages everywhere. She arranged objects in patterns. Unconscious conversation."

"That's impossible," James says.

"Everything about us is impossible." Chloe shows more documentation. Instagram posts. Her arrangements. Dates matching Hale's paintings. "We were talking without knowing. In frequencies only we could perceive."

"Mass delusion."

"Or connection that transcends normal perception."

She dims lights further. Activates the final setting—every UV frequency simultaneously.

---

## Part 5: The Full Revelation

The room transforms.

Not just UV now. Hale installed heat-reactive paint. Pressure-sensitive materials. Electromagnetic-responsive pigments. The gallery becomes living document of their story:

The flood rising (blue-black terror creeping up walls)
The tower isolation (silver cage of emergency lights)
The separation (gray void spreading)
The searching (purple desperation in corners)
The reunion (explosive rainbow at center)
The creation (infinite spectrum everywhere)

"Jesus Christ," someone breathes.

"How are you doing this?" Another voice, awed.

"I see in spectrums you don't," Chloe says simply. "Hale paints in them. Together we can make the invisible visible. Temporarily. Imperfectly. But enough."

"This is—" Dr. Tanaka approaches the wall, instrument in hand. "The UV readings are off the charts. But there's more. Infrared. Electromagnetic. You've created multispectrum art."

"We created documentation of connection," Hale corrects.

"Love letters in invisible ink," someone says. The crying woman from earlier. "I can see some of it. Not all, but—God, it's beautiful."

"You have it too," Chloe realizes. "Tetrachromacy."

"Partial. Not like yours. But enough to know this is real."

Another person steps forward. Then another. Three people total, admitting they see more than they should. A hidden community revealing itself.

"Four percent of women," Dr. Tanaka says. "That's the estimate for some form of tetrachromacy. Most never know. But in this room, with this art—"

"We're not alone," the first woman says. "Those of us who see impossible things."

---

## Part 6: The Challenge

"This proves nothing," James insists, but his voice wavers. "Collective hysteria. Power of suggestion."

"Then explain this," Chloe says.

She walks to a seemingly blank section of wall. Touches specific spots in sequence. Under her fingers, the wall responds—heat-activated paint revealing words only as she touches them.

"How did you know where to touch?" James demands.

"I can see the message underneath. Has been there all night. Want me to read it?"

"Anyone could have—"

She reads: "James Walker Holbrook. Born April 15, 1999. Tried to steal Hale's techniques June 2022. Failed. Had Derek lie about harassment. Failed again. Here tonight to document our methods. Will fail once more."

James goes white. "How—"

"Your laptop. The one you think is encrypted. You've been taking notes. The electromagnetic signature of your typing creates patterns I can see. You wrote: 'UV paint formulation seems to be—' Should I continue?"

"That's impossible."

"That's the point. We do impossible things. Create impossible art. Have impossible connection."

Hale joins her at the wall. Where he touches, different colors appear. Their hands create conversation in real-time—his heat, her perception, paint responding to both.

"You could learn this," Hale tells James. "Instead of stealing, you could learn."

"Learn what? To see things that aren't there?"

"To accept there are things you can't see. To collaborate instead of appropriate. To create instead of claim."

But James backs away. Pulls out his phone. "This isn't over. My father's lawyers—"

"Your father disowned you," someone says. New voice. Older man in expensive suit. "I'm Robert Holbrook. James is no longer associated with our galleries."

Plot twist. The crowd murmurs.

"Dad?" James's voice cracks. 

"I've been watching. All evening. Seeing you try to steal. Again. It ends now."

"But—"

"Go home, James. Think about who you want to be. Someone who steals art or someone who creates it."

James leaves. Defeated by his own father who came to see truth.

## Part 7: The Promise

The gallery empties slowly. People reluctant to leave the impossible made visible.

"We did it," Hale says.

They're alone now except for Maria cleaning up champagne glasses. All the lights on—regular, UV, infrared. The full spectrum singing.

"Made some of it visible," Chloe corrects.

"Enough of it."

"Never enough. There's always more frequencies. More layers."

"Good. Gives us something to do."

She laughs. Then sees it—new painting in the corner. Must have added it today while she was setting up. It's her, but not literally her. Her frequency. The exact color she creates in his vision. And in UV, words appear:

*Will you—*

"Yes," she says before reading more.

"You don't know what I'm asking."

"Doesn't matter. Yes."

"What if I'm asking you to move to Sweden?"

"Yes."

"What if I'm asking you to paint entirely in infrared?"

"Yes."

"What if I'm asking you to have seventeen children?"

"Okay, maybe to that."

He laughs. Golden sound in gallery light. "Was actually going to ask—will you make more impossible art with me?"

"Oh. Then definitely yes."

"For how long?"

"How long do you want?"

"Forever seems insufficient."

"Then multiple forevers. Serial infinities. Every spectrum that exists and ones we'll discover."

"That's a long time."

"Not long enough."

He reaches into his pocket. She sees his intention before he moves—purple-gold nervous hope.

"Also," he says.

"Also?"

A ring. But not just metal. Embedded with elements that react to UV, to heat, to electromagnetic fields. A ring that exists differently in every spectrum. In regular light: simple silver. In UV: seventeen different colors only she can see. In infrared: their heat creating new patterns together.

"Hale—"

"It's titanium core. Embedded with UV-reactive crystals I grew in the lab. Pressure-sensitive pigments that respond to your pulse. Electromagnetic threads that—"

"You made me a multispectrum ring?"

"I made you a ring that only you can fully see. That changes with your heartbeat. That exists in your frequencies."

"That's—"

"Impossible?"

"Perfect."

"So?"

"You haven't actually asked anything."

"Right. Yes." He kneels, which seems suddenly formal after everything. "Chloe Martinez. Will you marry me? In every spectrum? Visible and invisible? Known and unknown? Colors that have names and colors we'll name together?"

The ring blazes in her vision—seventeen warms made permanent, love transformed into wearable art.

"In every frequency," she says. "Every impossible spectrum. Every color that shouldn't exist but does because we exist."

He slides the ring on. It responds to her temperature. Shifts with her pulse. Creates colors that have no names because no one else will ever see them.

"I love you," he says. "In wavelengths I can't perceive but know are there."

"I love you in colors I can see but can't describe."

"That's inconvenient."

"That's us."

## Part 8: The Future Visible

Maria returns with a mop. Stops. Sees them.

"Oh my god, did he—did you—is that a ring?"

"It's a multispectrum commitment device," Chloe says.

"It's a ring. You're engaged. Holy shit, you're engaged!"

"We're something. Engaged seems insufficient."

"Frequency-bonded," Hale suggests.

"Spectrum-paired."

"Impossibly connected."

"That one," Chloe says. "We're impossibly connected."

Maria hugs them both. "I'm so happy I could cry. Am crying. Fuck." She wipes her eyes. "When's the wedding?"

"Sunset," they say together.

"When else?" Hale adds. "Thirty-seven degree angle."

"So our impossible colors will be visible."

"For four minutes."

"The only four minutes that matter."

Maria laughs. "You two are insane. Perfectly, beautifully insane."

The gallery holds their art. Their story. Their proof that invisible doesn't mean alone. The walls still pulse with UV messages. The sculptures cast shadows in spectrums most will never see.

But more—it holds their future. Painted in frequencies science hasn't discovered. In colors language hasn't named. In love that makes itself visible through impossible art.

"What now?" Maria asks.

Chloe looks at Hale. Sees their future in colors—studios full of UV light, children who might see even more spectrums, a world slowly learning that invisible doesn't mean unreal.

"Now we create," she says.

"More impossible things?"

"Everything impossible."

"Together?"

"No other way."

The gallery lights shift—someone outside adjusting streetlamps. For a moment, one perfect moment, every spectrum aligns. The entire space becomes visible—every layer, every message, every frequency singing at once.

Then it passes. Returns to mostly invisible.

But they saw it. All three of them. The full revelation.

Proof that impossible is just another word for not yet understood.
