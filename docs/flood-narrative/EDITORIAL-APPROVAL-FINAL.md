## ðŸŽ¯ FINAL EDITORIAL SIGN-OFF

This manuscript achieves something rare: it makes the scientifically impossible feel emotionally inevitable. The tetrachromacy/UV art premise creates a fresh metaphor for invisible connection that will resonate with anyone who has felt unseen or misunderstood.

The restructured Chapter 1 now properly builds mystery, the causal chain flows perfectly, and the love story feels both impossible and destined. The scientific grounding prevents fantasy from feeling arbitrary while the emotional truth makes the impossible feel real.

**"Things We Lost in the Flood" is a triumph of speculative romance that creates its own genre: frequency fiction.**

### RECOMMENDATION: PUBLISH IMMEDIATELY

No further edits required. The manuscript is exceptional and ready for readers.
