# STORY BIBLE - Things We Lost in the Flood

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

### NEVER NAME THE CONDITION IN EARLY CHAPTERS
- **DON'T SAY**: tetrachromacy, four cones, hundred million colors
- **DO**: Show her seeing impossible things, counting colors, experiencing frequencies
- **The reader discovers WITH her, not through exposition**

### SHOW DON'T TELL HIERARCHY
1. **Show through action/perception**: She sees seventeen shades in "white" tile
2. **Show through others' blindness**: Emma can't see the purple scarf
3. **Show through physical response**: Colors make her teeth ache, taste copper
4. **Let reader conclude**: She sees things others can't

### POWER MOVES IN ACTION
- **Privileged Perception**: We're IN her consciousness seeing impossible colors
- **Double-Encoded Scenes**: Surface conversation while underneath is color/frequency dialogue  
- **Free Indirect Style**: Let her perception bleed into narration without explaining
- **Failed Witness Test**: Others literally cannot see what she sees
- **Causal Weave**: BECAUSE she sees ‚Üí THEREFORE she acts ‚Üí BUT others can't see ‚Üí THEREFORE isolation

## üé® CHLOE'S PERCEPTION (Without Naming It)

### What She Experiences:
- Counts colors obsessively (seventeen variants in white)
- Tastes colors (copper-green, mint-silver-snow)  
- Hears frequencies (colors "screaming")
- Feels colors physically (teeth ache, skin burns)
- Sees UV spectrum (but doesn't know it's UV at first)
- Maps heat in seventeen zones (the seventeen warms)

### How Others React:
- "Staring at nothing"
- "Arranging things obsessively"  
- "Seeing things that aren't there"
- Think she's traumatized/mentally ill
- Can't see her photographs capture anything

### The Revelation:
- Chapter 4: Hale has painted a UV gallery
- He doesn't know anyone can see it
- She sees it perfectly  
- He recognizes she has something special
- Names it for first time: tetrachromacy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THINGS TO AVOID

### DON'T:
- Explain tetrachromacy before Chapter 4
- Use scientific terms in her POV early on
- Have her know why she sees differently
- Make others suddenly able to see
- Over-explain the condition ever

### DON'T USE THESE PHRASES (Before Chapter 4):
- "My tetrachromacy"
- "Four cones"  
- "Hundred million colors"
- "UV vision"
- "Genetic condition"

### INSTEAD USE:
- "The impossible colors"
- "Frequencies others can't see"
- "Seventeen shades where others see one"
- "Colors without names"
- "The screaming purple no one else notices"

---

## üìù DIALOGUE PHILOSOPHY

### "Fumbling Toward Understanding"
- Not perfect declarations
- Overlapping, interrupting, correcting
- Testing what's real through words
- Failure to explain the impossible
- Connection despite imperfect language

### Supporting Cast Matters
- Each character has distinct blindness
- Their inability to see emphasizes Chloe's ability
- They provide normal counterpoint
- Create isolation through kindness

## üéØ EMOTIONAL TRUTH

The story is about:
1. **Isolation**: Seeing what others can't
2. **Connection**: Finding someone else who sees/creates  
3. **Faith**: Believing despite impossible odds
4. **Art**: As communication beyond language
5. **Love**: In frequencies beyond visible

## üî¥ FINAL REMINDER

**The reader should feel Chloe's perception is strange and overwhelming BEFORE understanding why. The mystery IS the hook. The revelation IS the payoff.**

Never explain. Only experience.
