# Chapter 1 Revision - Critical Fix

## THE PROBLEM
Chapter 1 was explicitly naming "tetrachromacy" and "four cones" from the start, which ruins the mystery and discovery. This violates our core principle of privileged perception without explanation.

## THE SOLUTION  
Revised Chapter 1 to:
- Remove ALL mentions of "tetrachromacy" before Chapter 4
- Remove scientific explanations like "four cones" and "hundred million colors"
- Show her perception as mysterious and overwhelming
- Let others' inability to see create the isolation
- Make the reader experience her vision without understanding it

## KEY CHANGES

### Before:
"She has tetrachromatic vision with four cones..."

### After:  
"She sees seventeen shades where others see one..."

### Before:
"I have tetrachromacy. Four color cones instead of three."

### After:
"I can see them. The paintings. The impossible colors. All of it."

## THE RULE GOING FORWARD

**Chapters 1-3**: She sees impossible things. We don't know why.
**Chapter 4**: The UV gallery revelation - first time it's named
**Chapters 5+**: Understanding and exploration

## WHY THIS MATTERS

The mystery IS the hook. If we explain tetrachromacy immediately, we lose:
- Reader curiosity
- Chloe's own confusion/discovery
- The power of the Chapter 4 revelation
- The isolation of not understanding herself

## REMEMBER

- Show through perception, not explanation
- Use sensory language, not scientific terms  
- Let the reader feel confused WITH Chloe
- The not-knowing is part of the experience

This maintains the "fumbling toward understanding" philosophy not just in dialogue but in the entire narrative structure.
