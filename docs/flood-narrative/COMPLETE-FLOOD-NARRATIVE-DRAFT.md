# Part One: The Search
*Twenty Months After*

## Chapter 1: Frequencies Only She Can See
*September 17, 2024 - Twenty Months After the Flood*

### The Bathroom Discovery

The message shouldn't exist.

UV paint invisible to normal eyes blazes across the bathroom stall door in letters that taste like copper-salt-snow. Swedish. Fresh. Still tacky when Chloe touches it with her fingertip.

*Hitta mig där vattnet började.*

Find me where the water began.

Her heart stops. Twenty months of searching, and suddenly someone's here—or was here, minutes ago, hours at most. The paint is that fresh. She can smell the chemicals, seventeen different compounds her eyes translate into impossible colors: benzene (purple-silver), toluene (gold-green), UV-reactive polymers (a blue that has no name).

It has to be him. The one she's been searching for.

"You okay in there?" 

Emma from orientation. Pottery major. Can't hear with her own heart thumping.  Standing right outside, probably worried about the girl who's been in the bathroom stall for ten minutes making sounds like she's either crying or having a revelation.

Both, actually.

"Fine." Chloe's hand hovers over the latch.

"You sure? You've been in there a while."

"Period stuff," Chloe lies. Universal excuse. Conversation ender.

"Oh. Do you need—?"

"I'm good."

She could open the door.  Point. Say *look at the door. Tell me what you see.*

Her hand drops.

BECAUSE Emma won't see it.
THEREFORE Chloe stays silent.
BUT the message pulses like it's alive.

# Part Two: The Flood
*January 9-10, 2023*

## Chapter 4: When Emergency Lights Reveal
*January 9, 2023, 8:47 PM - Humanities Building, Second Floor*

### The Death of Light

The lights die.

No flicker. No warning. No slow fade like in movies where people have time to gasp, to reach for each other, to prepare. Just sudden black so complete she tastes it—burnt copper and snow, the flavor of absolute darkness flooding her mouth like she's drowning in it.

# Part Three: The Reunion
*September 18-19, 2024*

## Chapter 9: Seventeen Warms
*September 18, 2024 - Coffee Shop on State Street*

### Seventeen Minutes Early

The coffee shop on State Street smells wrong.

Not bad—just wrong. Like a painting copied from memory by someone who never learned to see the underlayers. Too much vanilla, not enough dust, and the vanilla itself reads amber-white with blue disaster-edges that spell out twenty months of everything-changed. The kind of wrong only someone with broken perception would notice: when you see too much, you taste the frequencies of what's missing.
