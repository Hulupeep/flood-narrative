# What are filter verbs (and why they hurt)

**Filter verbs** are verbs that insert the character’s mind as a *middleman* between the reader and the experience.
Common ones: *saw, heard, felt, noticed, realized, thought, wondered, looked, watched, seemed, decided, remembered, smelled, tasted, could see/hear*.

**Why they’re a problem**

* **Distance:** They remind us we’re reading *about* perception, not *having* it.
  *She saw the door was open* → we’re outside the moment.
* **Slack pace & weak verbs:** Filters burn words without adding image or action.
* **Voice dilution:** They fight free indirect style by tagging every thought.

**Easy fixes**

* **Delete the filter; promote the stimulus.**
  *She noticed cold air seeping in* → *Cold air seeped in.*
* **Swap to action/specific image.**
  *He heard a siren* → *A siren knifed the block.*
* **Let free indirect carry thoughts.**
  *She realized she was late* → *Late. Of course.*

**Before/After (your stall-door beat)**

* *She noticed there were strange letters on the door.*
* *Hooked letters blaze across the door.*

**When to keep a filter (on purpose)**

* **Control distance/attribution:** In multi-POV or brief omniscient, *she thought* can prevent confusion.
* **Doubt/subjectivity:** *It seemed louder today* (the seeming matters).
* **Contrast or misread:** *He thought the gun was fake* (sets up error).
* **Summary/transition:** Quick time jumps or compressing off-screen perception.

**5-minute self-edit**

1. Search for: *saw/heard/felt/noticed/realized/thought/wondered/seemed/decided/remembered/could see/could hear*.
2. For each, try deleting the filter. If clarity remains and the line gets sharper, keep the cut.
3. If you must keep it, make sure the **reason** is deliberate (distance, doubt, attribution).

Rule of thumb: **Experience first, interpreter second.**
