 Generic Editorial Checkpoint System for Any Writing Project

  üìù WORKFLOW SEQUENCE

  Step 1: Chapter/Section Completion

  Action: Writer completes a chapter/section expansion
  Output: Full text file (typically 5,000-6,000 words)
  Resources: Story bible, style guide, previous chapters for reference

  Step 2: Editorial Task Initiation

  Action: Spawn specialized editorial review task
  Resources Provided to Editors:
  - The newly completed chapter
  - Story bible/rules document
  - Character voice guide
  - Timeline/chronology tracker
  - Previous chapters for continuity
  Output: Task assigned to editorial team

  Step 3: Multi-Agent Editorial Review

  Agents Deployed (simultaneously):
  - Managing Editor: Overall coordination and final verdict
  - Plot Editor: Story structure, pacing, narrative arc
  - Timeline Editor: Chronological accuracy, sequence logic
  - Continuity Editor: Fact checking, consistency
  - Voice Editor: Character dialogue and narrative tone
  - Location Editor: Setting accuracy and spatial logic
  - Dialogue Editor: Conversation naturalness and flow

  Process: Each agent reviews the same text through their specialized lens

  Step 4: Assessment Compilation

  Action: Each editor provides structured feedback
  Output Format:
  STRENGTHS:
  - [What works well in their domain]

  ISSUES:
  - [Problems identified]

  CRITICAL VIOLATIONS:
  - [Story-breaking errors]

  SCORE: X/10

  Step 5: Managing Editor Synthesis

  Action: Managing editor integrates all feedback
  Output: Comprehensive assessment report containing:
  - Aggregated strengths
  - Prioritized issue list
  - Critical violations (if any)
  - Scored metrics (typically 5-7 categories)
  - Overall score
  - Verdict (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)

  Step 6: Decision Point

  Based on Verdict:

  üü¢ GREEN LIGHT (Score 8+/10, no critical violations)
  - Next Action: Proceed to next chapter
  - Documentation: Add to progress tracker
  - No revision required

  üü° YELLOW LIGHT (Score 6-8/10, minor issues)
  - Next Action: Note issues for later revision pass
  - Documentation: Create fix list for post-drafting
  - Continue writing but track needed changes

  üî¥ RED LIGHT (Score <6/10 or critical violations)
  - Next Action: STOP progression
  - Immediate revision required
  - Re-submit for editorial review after fixes
  - Cannot proceed until GREEN or YELLOW achieved

  üóÇÔ∏è RESOURCE DOCUMENTS MAINTAINED

  Input Resources (What Editors Need)

  1. Story Bible: Core rules, reveal timeline, world-building
  2. Character Guide: Voice patterns, speech quirks, development arcs
  3. Timeline Tracker: Chronological event sequence
  4. Location Bible: Setting details, geography, spatial relationships
  5. Style Guide: Prose style, POV rules, technical conventions

  Output Documents (What System Produces)

  1. Chapter Assessment Reports: Individual chapter reviews
  2. Master Progress Tracker: Overall manuscript status
  3. Issue Log: Running list of needed fixes
  4. Continuity Database: Facts, names, details for consistency
  5. Quality Metrics Dashboard: Scores and trends over time

  üéØ GENERIC PRINCIPLES

  The System Ensures:

  1. Consistency at Scale
  - Same editorial standards applied to chapter 1 and chapter 50
  - Multiple perspectives catch different types of errors
  - Systematic approach prevents editorial fatigue

  2. Early Error Detection
  - Critical violations caught immediately
  - Prevents compound errors from building
  - Saves massive revision time later

  3. Quality Maintenance
  - Word count goals don't compromise story quality
  - Every scene must justify its existence
  - Padding and repetition identified

  4. Progressive Improvement
  - Tracks which issues recur
  - Identifies writer's blind spots
  - Shows improvement over time

  üîÑ ITERATIVE CYCLE

  Write ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Assess ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí {Continue OR Revise} ‚Üí Track ‚Üí Repeat

  This creates a sustainable, scalable editorial process that maintains
  quality across long-form writing projects while providing clear,
  actionable feedback at each stage.

  The beauty is its modularity - you can adjust the number of editors, the
  specific checkpoints, and the scoring thresholds based on your project's
  needs, but the fundamental workflow remains consistent and reliable.
