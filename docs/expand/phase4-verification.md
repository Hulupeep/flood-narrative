# Expansion Plan: Phase 4 - Integration & Editorial Verification

**TO:** Full Editorial Team (Paul, Chris, Theo, Tara, Casey, Logan, Val, Lena)
**FROM:** Morgan (Managing Editor)
**RE:** Protocol and Checklists for Verifying the 15k-Word Expansion

## 1. Objective

With the eight new scenes integrated into the manuscript, we now enter the critical verification phase. The goal is to ensure the "Surgical Deepening" has been successful and the new material has enhanced, not compromised, the narrative architecture. 

This document provides role-specific checklists for each editor. Your task is to review the **new scenes and their immediate surrounding chapters** with a specific focus on the questions below. Log your findings in the *Master Editorial Board Doc*.

Adherence to this protocol is mandatory to maintain the quality standards outlined in `editors.md`.

## 2. General Protocol

1.  Read the new scene.
2.  Read the chapter preceding it and the chapter following it.
3.  Assess the scene based on your role-specific checklist below.
4.  Provide a "Pass / Fail" rating for each checklist item, with a brief explanation for any "Fail" ratings.

## 3. Role-Specific Verification Checklists

### **Paul (Plot Structure Editor)**
*   **Causal Weave Integrity:** Does the new scene maintain a perfect "therefore/but" causal link? Is it directly *caused* by the previous scene and does it directly *cause* the next? (Y/N)
*   **Pacing Impact:** Does the new scene accelerate momentum and increase stakes, or does it feel like a pause or detour? (Accelerates / Pauses)
*   **Plot Redundancy:** Does the scene introduce information or a plot beat that is already present elsewhere? (Y/N)

### **Chris (Character Development Editor)**
*   **Misbelief Confrontation:** Does the scene actively challenge the designated character's core misbelief as defined in `phase1-analysis.md`? (Y/N)
*   **Arc Progression:** Does the character's emotional state demonstrably shift from the beginning of the scene to the end, in a way that feels earned and moves their overall arc forward? (Y/N)
*   **Behavioral Consistency:** Are the character's actions within the scene a believable manifestation of their established protective behaviors? (Y/N)

### **Theo (Thematic Editor)**
*   **Thematic Resonance:** Does the scene reinforce one of the novel's core themes (e.g., "Trusting unconventional data," "Escaping false labels")? (Y/N)
*   **Symbolism:** If recurring symbols (the color green, vinyl records) are used, is their meaning deepened or merely repeated? (Deepened / Repeated)

### **Tara (Timeline Editor) & Casey (Continuity Editor)**
*   **Chronological Flow:** Does the new scene fit seamlessly into the established timeline without creating contradictions? (Y/N)
*   **Continuity Check:** Are all details (time of day, character locations, status of equipment, etc.) consistent with the scenes before and after? (Y/N)

### **Logan (Location Editor)**
*   **Spatial Logic:** Is the physical space in the new scene consistent with established locations? Do the actions within it make sense spatially? (Y/N)
*   **Atmosphere:** Does the description of the location enhance the scene's emotional tone? (Y/N)

### **Val (Voice Editor) & Valeria (Dialog Editor)**
*   **Voice Authenticity:** Do Chloe and Hale sound like themselves? Are their dialogue patterns, tics, and vocabulary consistent with their profiles? (Y/E)
*   **Subtext Execution:** For scenes marked as `Double-Encoded`, is the subtext clear to the reader while remaining believably hidden from the other character? (Y/N)
*   **Dialogue Ratio:** Does the scene adhere to the project's 40/60 dialogue-to-narrative guideline? (Y/N)

### **Lena (Line Editor / Prose Stylist)**
*   **Power Move Execution:** Is the assigned `powermoves.md` technique implemented effectively and with precision? (Y/N)
*   **Kinetic Structure:** Does the prose follow the high-compression, modular style? Are the paragraph "clifflets" effective? (Y/N)
*   **Isolation Button Impact:** Is the final line of the scene a strong, resonant isolation button? (Y/N)

## 4. Final Verdict

A new scene is only considered successfully integrated if it receives a "Pass" on **all** checklist items from **all** editors. Any "Fail" rating will trigger a mandatory revision cycle, to be addressed by the appropriate writing and editing specialists before a final approval is granted.
