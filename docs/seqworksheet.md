Got it — here’s the breakdown.

## **Analysis of the Technique**

**Name:** Writing Backwards / Reverse Cause and Effect (Jeff Kitchen)

**Core Idea:**
Instead of plotting events forward from the beginning, you start at the *final effect* and work backwards by asking **“What directly caused this?”** — not “What came before this?”
This ensures a tight, unbroken chain of cause and effect, stripping away all unnecessary scenes and plot beats.

---

### **Why It Works**

1. **Focuses on necessity** – Only events that *directly cause* the next beat survive; tangential or decorative scenes get cut.
2. **Eliminates filler** – Removes charming but irrelevant “dead wood” that doesn’t drive the plot.
3. **Maintains tension** – The forward version feels inevitable because every moment is causally linked.
4. **Structures from outcome → origin** – Like engineering backwards from a finished machine, you ensure all story “parts” connect to the end result.
5. **Improves clarity** – Separates what’s essential (cause) from what’s incidental (things that happen before but don’t cause).

### **Key Rules**

* Start with the **Object** — the ultimate goal or transformation of the story.
* Define the **Final Effect** — the last thing the audience sees that proves the object happened.
* Work backwards: each step must **cause** the one after it, no gaps.
* Never ask “what happens before?” — ask **“what causes this?”**
* Once you have the backward chain, you can play it forward to build scenes.

## **Direct LLM Prompt**

Here’s a precise, LLM-friendly instruction set so any AI understands and applies the method:

**Prompt:**
*"You are a story structure assistant. I will give you a story concept. Your task is to apply Jeff Kitchen’s ‘Reverse Cause and Effect’ method to create a tight chain of events. Follow these rules exactly:*

1. **State the Object** – in one sentence, describe the ultimate story goal or transformation.
2. **State the Final Effect** – the specific, on-screen event that proves the object has been achieved.
3. Starting from the Final Effect, work backwards by repeatedly asking:

   > ‘What is the single, direct cause of this event?’
4. Write each cause as a separate bullet point, labeling them ‘Cause 1,’ ‘Cause 2,’ etc., until you reach the logical start of the story or sequence.
5. Only include events that directly cause the next one. If an event merely precedes but doesn’t cause it, leave it out.
6. After the backward chain is complete, present it in **forward order** to show how it plays to the audience.
7. Be specific about characters, actions, and stakes in each step — no vague summaries."\*

**Example Input:**
*"A detective catches a serial art thief who has been taunting her for years."*

**Example Output Structure:**
**Object:** The detective captures the art thief, restoring her reputation.
**Final Effect:** The thief is handcuffed in the museum’s security room.
Cause 1: The detective locks the museum doors remotely after luring the thief inside...
*(continue until origin)*

If you want, I can **demonstrate** this with a brand new example so you can see how a model would follow it exactly. Would you like me to do that?
