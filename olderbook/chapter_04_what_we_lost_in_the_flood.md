# Chapter 4 - Dylan

She finds me first this time.

Replacing broken tiles around the lagoon. Small artificial lake that sits at the heart of campus like something someone designed to look natural but got the proportions slightly wrong. Early morning. The kind of October day that makes you forget summer ever ends in California. Been working since seven to beat the foot traffic that starts around nine when first classes let out.

Tiles are old ceramic. Probably installed in the seventies when someone thought earth tones were permanent. Half cracked from ground settling. Other half loose from decades of sprinkler runoff and student feet and maintenance crews like me doing patch jobs instead of real repairs.

On my knees, scraping old adhesive from concrete. Hear footsteps that stop instead of continuing past. Look up—Maya standing about ten feet away. Holding a coffee cup. Looking like she's trying to decide something.

"Hi," she says.

"Hi."

"I went to that place you mentioned. In the Education building."

"Yeah?"

"It's perfect. Thank you."

I nod and go back to scraping adhesive. The sun is already getting hot, and I want to get the clean tiles set before the adhesive starts skinning over.

But she doesn't leave.

"What are you working on?" she asks.

"Tile replacement. Water damage."

"From what?"

Sit back on my heels. Look at the lagoon. Supposed to be decorative but mostly just collects runoff and algae and the occasional family of ducks that don't seem to care about the aesthetic principles of landscape architecture.

"System's not sealed properly," I say. "Water finds its way under the tiles. Freezes and expands in winter. Cracks everything apart."

"Ah." She moves closer, careful not to step on the work area I've marked off with orange cones. "So you have to replace them regularly?"

"Every few years."

"That seems inefficient."

"Yeah. It is."

"Why not fix the underlying problem?"

Look at her more carefully. Wearing jeans and a UCSB sweatshirt. Hair pulled back in a ponytail—suggests she planned to be outside today. Her question sounds like someone who thinks systematically about problems. Not just making conversation.

"Budget," I say. "Fixing the drainage would mean tearing up half the walkway, rerouting pipes, waterproofing the whole system. Easier to just replace tiles as they break."

"Easier for who?"

Good question. Easier for the people who approve maintenance budgets, maybe. Not easier for the person who has to come out here every October to scrape off old adhesive and set new tiles that will crack again by February.

"For the people who don't have to do the work," I say.

She smiles at that. First real smile I've seen from her. Changes her whole face. Makes her look less careful and more... present.

"Can I watch?" she asks. "I mean, is that weird? I just... I like seeing how things get fixed."

Most people don't ask to watch maintenance work. Most people pretend not to see maintenance work happening at all. Like the things they use every day repair themselves through some kind of benevolent magic.

"Sure," I say.

Maya sits on a nearby bench. Pulls out her notebook—same one I saw her with in the library. But this time she doesn't write in it. Just watches while I measure and cut and fit new tiles into place. Her attention focused in a way that makes me more conscious of my own movements.

"You're good at that," she says after I've set three tiles in a row that line up perfectly with the existing pattern.

"Practice."

"How long have you been doing this kind of work?"

"Since high school. Started part-time, kept at it after graduation."

"Did you go to college?"

Question isn't judgmental. Just curious. Still feel the familiar weight of explanation that comes with answering it.

"Two years at SBCC," I say. "Studying engineering. Didn't finish."

"Why not?"

"Money. And I was better at the hands-on stuff than the theory."

"What kind of theory?"

Spread adhesive on the back of another tile. Consider how much to say. "Fluid dynamics. Thermodynamics. Structural analysis. All the math behind why things work the way they do."

"But you understand that stuff. I can tell by the way you talk about the drainage problem."

"Understanding and proving you understand are different things."

Maya nods like this makes perfect sense to her. "I'm terrible at proving I understand things. I can see patterns and connections, but when I try to explain them in papers or presentations, it all comes out wrong."

"What kind of patterns?"

She's quiet for a moment, watching me set another tile. "Environmental stuff, mostly. The way human systems interact with natural systems. Like, we build cities as if we can control nature, but nature just... adapts. Finds the weak points. Works around our plans."

"Like water under tiles."

"Exactly like water under tiles."

Finish the row I'm working on. Sit back to check alignment. New tiles look bright and clean against the older ones. By next year they'll all match again. Weathered by sun and foot traffic and sprinkler water that carries mineral deposits and whatever else gets dissolved in the campus irrigation system.

"Maya?"

"Yeah?"

"What are you really studying? I mean, what's your actual major?"

"Environmental studies. But I'm focusing on coastal systems. Erosion, sea level rise, storm impacts."

"Flood management?"

"Among other things."

Something in the way she says this. Makes me think we're approaching the edge of whatever she doesn't want to talk about. Keep working. Give her space to decide whether she wants to cross that edge or step back from it.

"Dylan?"

"Yeah?"

"Can I ask you something personal?"

"Okay."

"Do you ever feel like you're good at fixing everything except the things that actually matter?"

Stop working. Look at her. She's staring at the lagoon. Notebook open on her lap but empty. Fingers wrapped around her coffee cup like it's the only thing keeping her anchored to the bench.

"Yeah," I say. "Every day."

"What are the things that matter? For you?"

"Family stuff, mostly. My dad's been out of work for eight months. My mom pretends everything's fine, but she's working double shifts to cover the mortgage. My sister's starting her senior year. Smart enough for college but we can't afford to send her anywhere good."

Maya nods slowly. "Things that can't be fixed with tools."

"Right."

"For me it's..." She stops, starts again. "I used to think I could understand things well enough to prevent them. Bad things. If I studied coastal erosion, I could predict where the problems would be and help people prepare. But studying something and being able to do anything about it are completely different."

"What kinds of problems?"

She's quiet for so long I think she's not going to answer.

Then she says, "People losing everything they care about because they didn't know to get out of the way in time."

"Floods?"

"Yeah. Floods."

We sit with that for a moment. Lagoon reflects the morning sky. All blue and white and perfect. Like a postcard of how beautiful California can be when the weather cooperates.

But underneath, I know, water is slowly working its way under the tiles I just set. Starting the process that will crack them apart by next winter.

"Maya?"

"Yeah?"

"You want to help me with something?"

"With what?"

"There's a drain outlet on the other side of the lagoon that's been clogged for weeks. Maintenance keeps putting it on the low-priority list because it's not an emergency yet. But if we get any real rain, it's going to back up and flood the whole walkway."

She looks at me carefully. "You want me to help you fix a drain that's not officially broken yet?"

"I want to show you something that might not be fixable with tools, but is definitely fixable with attention."

"Preventive maintenance."

"Yeah."

Maya closes her notebook and stands up. "Okay."

We walk around the lagoon together. Find myself noticing things I usually don't pay attention to. Way her footsteps match my pace without trying to. Way she stops to look at details—pattern of algae growth along the water's edge, places where concrete has started to crack from root pressure, small ecosystem of insects and birds that have adapted to this artificial environment.

"It's not really a lake, is it?" she says.

"No. It's just a big concrete bowl with a recirculation system."

"But the ducks don't know that."

Follow her gaze to a family of mallards that have taken up residence in the cattails someone planted to make the lagoon look more natural. "No. They don't."

"That's interesting. From their perspective, it's completely real."

"From their perspective, it works exactly like it's supposed to."

Drain outlet is exactly as clogged as I expected. Packed with leaves and debris and a summer's worth of organic matter that's turned into a solid mass. Would take maybe thirty minutes to clear it properly. But those thirty minutes haven't made it onto anyone's official schedule yet.

"How bad would the flooding be?" Maya asks, crouching down to examine the blockage.

"Depends on how much rain we get. If it's just normal winter precipitation, probably just puddles. But if we get a real storm..." Look at the surrounding walkways. Calculate water flow and drainage capacity. "Could be a couple inches deep across this whole area."

"Enough to damage the building foundations?"

"Maybe. And definitely enough to make this part of campus impassable for anyone who can't wade through standing water."

Maya nods, and I can see her working through the implications. Students with mobility issues. Faculty trying to get to classes. Delivery trucks and maintenance vehicles that need access to the buildings on this side of campus.

"So it's not just a drain problem," she says.

"It's an accessibility problem. An infrastructure problem. A planning problem."

"And it could be prevented with thirty minutes of work."

"Yeah."

Maya stands up and looks at the lagoon, the walkways, the buildings that surround this carefully designed outdoor space. "Can you fix it now?"

"Technically, I'm not supposed to work on things that aren't on my current work order."

"But you could?"

"I could."

"What do you need?"

Consider this. Drain cleaning itself is straightforward—just a matter of breaking up the blockage and flushing the debris downstream. But I'd need someone to hold tools, manage the equipment, maybe help with the more awkward parts of the process.

"A partner," I say. "Someone who doesn't mind getting dirty and can follow instructions."

Maya rolls up her sleeves. "I'm good at following instructions."

For the next hour, we work together to clear the drain. Maya holds the flashlight while I break up the worst of the blockage. Then helps me flush the system with water from a nearby spigot. She asks good questions about what I'm doing and why. Anticipates what I need before I have to ask for it.

When we're finished, water flows freely through the outlet for the first time in months. Not glamorous work. Not the kind of thing that gets noticed unless it fails. But it's the kind of problem that stays solved once you solve it properly.

"There," I say, wiping my hands on a rag. "Crisis averted."

"For now."

"For this season, anyway."

Maya is looking at her hands. Streaked with mud and organic matter and whatever else accumulates in neglected drainage systems. She doesn't seem bothered by the dirt. Surprises me. Most people I know would be looking for the nearest bathroom to scrub themselves clean.

"Dylan?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for letting me help."

"You're the one who helped me."

"No, I mean... thank you for showing me that prevention is possible. That some problems can be solved before they become disasters."

Something in her voice. Makes me think we're still not just talking about drain maintenance.

"Maya?"

"Yeah?"

"What happened? The flood you mentioned earlier?"

She's quiet for a long time. Looking at the lagoon where the ducks are paddling in circles. Undisturbed by our morning's work.

"I lived through something that I should have seen coming," she says finally. "And people got hurt because I didn't pay attention to the right things."

"What kinds of things?"

"Warning signs. Weather patterns. The difference between normal problems and the kind of problems that change everything."

Wait for her to say more. She doesn't. Instead, pulls out her notebook and writes something down. Not many words. Just a few lines that she closes the cover over before I can see them.

"I should probably go," she says. "I have class in an hour."

"Yeah. Me too. I mean, work orders."

But neither of us moves immediately. Stand there beside the lagoon. Both of us dirty from honest work. Both of us having shared something that feels more significant than drain cleaning.

"Dylan?"

"Yeah?"

"Would you... would you want to get coffee sometime? When you're not working?"

"Yeah. I'd like that."

"Good." She smiles, the same real smile from earlier. "I'll find you."

After she leaves, pack up my tools. Finish setting the last few tiles around the lagoon. Work goes faster without conversation. But feels less satisfying somehow. Like I'd gotten used to having someone witness the process of fixing things. Someone who understood that maintenance is really about attention and care and the kind of foresight that prevents small problems from becoming large ones.

That evening, sit in my apartment with my notebook. Try to write down what happened today. Not the mechanics of tile replacement or drain cleaning. The other thing—the sense that Maya sees patterns I don't know I'm part of. That she might need someone who understands the difference between fixing and preventing.

Write:

*Today she asked if I ever feel like I'm good at fixing everything except the things that actually matter.

The answer is yes.

But didn't tell her the rest—
that talking to her makes me think
some of the things that matter
might be fixable after all.

She says she lived through something
she should have seen coming.
Want to ask what kind of thing.
Afraid the question will make her disappear
back into whatever careful distance
she keeps between herself and the world.

Instead, showed her how to prevent
a small disaster.
How to clear a drain
before it backs up and floods the walkway.

It's not the same as preventing
the kind of disaster that changes everything.
But it's a place to start.*

Outside my window, campus settles into evening quiet. Lights coming on in buildings where people are studying or working or just trying to make sense of the day they've lived through.

Tomorrow there will be new work orders. New things that need fixing. New systems that have failed in predictable ways.

But tonight I'm thinking about Maya's question—whether I'm good at fixing everything except the things that actually matter.

For the first time, starting to think the answer might be more complicated than yes or no.

The things that matter most
might not be broken, exactly.

They might just need someone
who knows how to pay attention to them
before they break.
