# Chapter 6 - Dylan

The maintenance request comes in at 7:23 AM: broken window latch in Davidson Library, eighth floor. I know before I check the location that it's the Pacific View Room where Maya sits every Tuesday morning, staring at water she won't admit she's avoiding.

I grab my toolbox and head across campus. The morning air smells like rain that hasn't decided whether to fall yet, and students move past me the way they always do—like I'm part of the infrastructure, necessary but invisible.

The elevator in Davidson carries me up through floors of accumulated knowledge, past shelves of books that promise answers to questions I'm learning to ask. At the eighth floor, I push through the heavy doors and find her there, exactly where I knew she'd be.

Maya sits with her back to the windows, Environmental Science textbook open but unread. Her jade bracelet catches the light as she touches it, thirty-seven times in the span of watching her for two minutes. She's wearing the gray sweater that means she didn't sleep well, and her coffee cup sits empty beside her, lipstick mark on the rim like punctuation at the end of a sentence she's afraid to finish.

I check the window latch she called about. It's not broken—just stiff from years of salt air and neglect. Needs oil and patience, not replacement.

While I work, I notice things I've started writing down:

Maya never sits with her back to the water, but she calls in maintenance requests for windows that face the ocean. Creates reasons for someone to stand between her and what she studies. This is the fifth window repair this semester. None of them have been actually broken.

I oil the hinges, test the latch mechanism. The window opens smooth now, letting in the sound of waves hitting the shore eight stories below. Maya's shoulders tense at the sound.

"All fixed," I say.

She looks up from her textbook like she's surprised to find me there, though she's the one who called facilities. "Oh. Thank you."

Her voice catches on the words the way it does when she's lying. Not lying about gratitude—lying about being surprised. She knows exactly when I'll arrive for these not-broken windows. She's memorized the maintenance schedule the same way she's memorized campus evacuation routes and the depth of every storm drain on campus.

I should leave. Pack my tools and move on to the next request, the broken radiator in Phelps Hall that actually needs fixing. Instead, I find myself asking, "What are you studying?"

"Coastal erosion patterns." She closes the textbook too quickly, like she's been caught reading something she shouldn't. "For a paper."

The textbook is upside down. Has been the whole time I've been here.

"Interesting," I say.

"Not really." Maya's fingers find her bracelet again. "It's just... systems failing. Water finding the weak spots. Nothing you can do to stop it, just try to predict where it'll break next."

I set my toolbox down on the table across from her. She watches my hands as I organize the tools back into their designated spaces—socket wrenches by size, screwdrivers by type. Everything has its place. Everything can be found when needed.

"You could reinforce the weak spots," I say. "Before they break."

"Could you?"

The question hangs between us like the salt air hanging between campus and ocean. She's not asking about erosion anymore.

"Depends on the structure," I say. "Some things need reinforcement. Some things need to be rebuilt from foundation up."

Maya's looking at me now instead of past me, the way she usually does when I'm fixing things around her. Really looking, like she's trying to figure out which category I belong in—the maintenance or the people who call for it.

"What about things that are already broken?" she asks.

"What about them?"

"Can they be fixed? Or do you just work around the damage?"

I think about the radiator in Phelps Hall, the one that's been leaking for three years. Physical Plant keeps sending me to patch it, but what it really needs is full replacement. New pipes, new connections, new everything. The building's too old, the infrastructure too compromised. We just keep applying temporary solutions to permanent problems.

"Sometimes," I say, "working around the damage is the only way to keep things functioning."

Maya nods like this makes sense to her. Like she's been working around damage for so long she's forgotten what functioning without it would look like.

"Do you ever wish," she says, then stops. Shakes her head. "Never mind."

"What?"

"Nothing. It's stupid."

I wait. This is something I've learned about Maya—she fills silence the way water fills low places, inevitably, if you give her time.

"Do you ever wish you could fix people the way you fix windows?" she asks finally. "Just oil the hinges, adjust the mechanisms, make everything work smooth again?"

"No," I say.

The answer surprises her. She was expecting me to say yes, maybe. Or to make some joke about people being more complicated than windows.

"Why not?"

"Because people aren't broken windows. When a window breaks, it stops working. When people break, they find new ways to work. Different ways. Sometimes better ways."

Maya's touching her bracelet again, but slower now. Like she's thinking about something instead of anxious about it.

"That's very..." she searches for the word. "Optimistic."

"Is it?"

"Isn't it?"

I consider this. My toolbox contains seventeen different types of repair equipment, from simple lubricants to complete replacement parts. But the most important tool isn't in the box—it's knowing when to repair and when to rebuild, when to fix and when to work around.

"I don't think it's optimistic," I say. "I think it's realistic. Things break. Systems fail. People adapt. The adaptation isn't failure—it's survival."

Maya closes her eyes. When she opens them, they're focused on something outside the window, something I can't see.

"What if the adaptation hurts other people?" she asks.

"What do you mean?"

"What if surviving means someone else doesn't?"

The question sits between us like broken glass. Sharp enough to cut, impossible to ignore.

"Maya," I say. "What happened to you?"

She looks at me then, really looks, and for a moment I think she's going to tell me. The truth, whatever it is that makes her study water damage like penance and count exits like prayers. The thing that broke her in a way that made her work differently, not better or worse, just different.

Instead, she says, "It's raining."

It is. Started while we were talking, fat drops hitting the window I just fixed. The sound makes Maya's shoulders tighten again.

"I should go," she says, gathering her things.

"Maya."

She stops.

"The window latch," I say. "It wasn't broken. Just needed maintenance."

She nods like she already knew this. Like she's known all along that she's been calling me to fix things that only need attention, not repair.

"Thank you," she says. "For the maintenance."

She leaves, and I finish packing my tools. But I don't leave right away. Instead, I stand at the window she faces away from and look out at the ocean, trying to see what she sees when she's not looking.

The water stretches gray and endless to the horizon, punctuated by whitecaps that look like scattered thoughts. Montecito is visible in the distance, houses rebuilt on hillsides that remember what water can do when it decides to move.

I understand now why Maya calls me to fix windows she never looks through. She needs someone to stand between her and the view, needs the sound of tools working to drown out whatever she hears when she's alone with the water.

But I also understand that she's not trying to hide from what she sees. She's trying to find a way to look at it safely. The broken windows aren't really broken—they're requests for accompaniment. For someone to witness what she can't witness alone.

Tomorrow there will probably be another maintenance request. A door that sticks, a light that flickers, a thermostat that needs adjustment. None of them will be broken in ways that matter. All of them will be Maya's way of asking for what she can't ask for directly: help learning to function around damage.

I pack my tools and head to Phelps Hall, to the radiator that actually needs fixing. But I'm already thinking about what I'll write in my notebook tonight:

*Day 847: Girl in the library creates work for maintenance staff. Not because things are broken, but because being alone with broken things is worse than admitting you need company. Calls it "fixing windows." Actually asking for something else. Still learning what.*

The rain picks up as I walk across campus, and I think about adaptation. About systems that learn to work around their damage instead of pretending the damage doesn't exist.

About Maya, who studies erosion not to prevent it, but to understand how things survive after they've been carved away by forces too big to fight.

About myself, writing observations about her like field notes, trying to document something I don't have words for yet.

The radiator in Phelps Hall is leaking worse than last week. I'll patch it again, buy another month of temporary function. But eventually, someone will have to decide whether to rebuild from the foundation up or find a different way to heat the building entirely.

Some decisions can't be postponed forever.

Maya knows this better than anyone. She's been making those decisions since whatever happened to make her study water like an enemy she needs to understand. Since whatever choice she made that taught her survival sometimes comes at a cost she's still calculating.

I fix the radiator and wonder what it would look like for Maya to stop patching temporary solutions onto permanent problems. What it would look like for her to rebuild from the foundation up, or find an entirely different way to generate the warmth she needs.

But that's not my job. My job is to show up when she calls, to fix what can be fixed, and to understand that sometimes the thing that needs repair isn't the thing she names in the work order.

My job is to be the company she needs while she figures out how to look at the water without asking someone else to stand between her and the view.

The rain keeps falling. I keep working. Tomorrow, Maya will probably call about another window that isn't broken.

And I'll keep showing up, carrying tools that can fix hinges and latches and all the small mechanisms that help things open and close properly.

But the most important tool I carry isn't in my toolbox. It's the understanding that sometimes people don't need to be fixed—they need to be seen working around their damage, adapting in ways that let them survive.

Maya is surviving. Different than before, but surviving.

That's not failure. That's engineering.

That's love, though I don't write that word down yet.
