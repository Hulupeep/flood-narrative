# Chapter 14: Choosing to Stay
## Dylan's POV - Present Tense

Maya's thesis defense is scheduled for April 15th, and it's March 30th, and she's been living in the library for two weeks like a refugee from her own life. I bring her coffee at 2 PM every day—black when she's punishing herself, cream when she's not—and I've learned to read her emotional state by how she holds her pen when she writes.

Today she's holding it like a weapon.

"It's not working," she says without looking up from the laptop screen where she's been typing and deleting the same paragraph for the past hour. "The autoethnography section. It sounds like therapy disguised as scholarship."

I set the coffee down next to her elbow—black today, because she's been in punishment mode since her committee raised concerns about methodological rigor. "Maybe that's not a bad thing."

"Dylan, this is an academic thesis. It has to meet academic standards. It can't just be me processing trauma in APA format."

I sit down across from her at the study table she's claimed as her own, the one with the view of the campus lagoon that used to terrify her and now just makes her thoughtful. "What did Dr. Vance say?"

"She said the committee is worried about the ethical implications of using personal trauma as research data. They want me to include more traditional methodological frameworks, more distance between the researcher and the subject."

Maya finally looks at me, and I can see the exhaustion in her face. Not just tired from late nights in the library, but the deeper exhaustion that comes from choosing honesty when dishonesty would be easier.

"They want me to write about Elena Rodriguez like she's a case study instead of someone I killed."

The word "killed" hangs in the air between us. Maya has started using it more often lately, not as self-flagellation but as precision. She's done with euphemisms, done with the careful language that makes terrible choices sound like accidents.

"What do you want to do?" I ask.

"I want to quit. I want to go back to the safe version of the thesis and graduate without anyone knowing what I did and get a job somewhere far from here and pretend none of this ever happened."

She's crying now, but quietly, the way she cries when she's angry at herself for crying.

"But I can't. Because quitting would be choosing the paintings again. Choosing safety over truth, protection over people. And I can't keep making that choice."

I reach across the table and take her hand, and her fingers are cold from the library air conditioning and slightly stained with ink from a pen that's been leaking.

"Maya, you don't have to torture yourself to make amends."

"Don't I?"

"No. You have to tell the truth and live with the consequences and try to choose better going forward. But you don't have to bleed publicly to prove you're sorry."

She looks at me with something like surprise. "You think I should quit?"

"I think you should do whatever lets you live with yourself. And I think you've already proven you can live with telling the truth. The question is whether you can live with backing down from it."

Maya is quiet for a long moment, looking out at the lagoon where students are studying on blankets, preparing for finals, living the kinds of lives where the worst decision they've made is probably choosing the wrong major or dating the wrong person.

"I used to think the hardest part was carrying the secret," she says. "But it's not. The hardest part is carrying the truth. Because secrets are private, but truth has to be shared. Truth has to be witnessed. And once people know the truth about you, they get to decide whether you deserve their love or respect or professional regard."

"And that scares you."

"It terrifies me. Because what if I tell the truth and everyone decides I'm exactly as terrible as I think I am? What if my committee fails my thesis? What if I can't get into graduate school? What if I spend the rest of my life being known as the girl who let her neighbor die for watercolor paintings?"

I understand this fear. I've lived with a version of it my whole life—the fear that if people really knew me, they'd see what my father saw. Someone not worth staying for. Someone not worth choosing.

"Maya, look at me."

She does.

"I know the truth about you. Dr. Vance knows the truth about you. Your parents know the truth about you. And we're all still here."

"That's three people out of seven billion."

"That's three people who matter. And if your committee can't see that what you're doing—using your own moral injury to understand how communities heal from individual failures—if they can't see that this is exactly the kind of scholarship the world needs more of, then they don't deserve to evaluate your work."

Maya smiles, but it's small and sad. "You have a lot of faith in me."

"I have faith in what you choose to do with who you are. That's different."

She closes her laptop and leans back in her chair, looking at me with the kind of attention that still surprises me. Like I'm someone worth really seeing.

"Dylan, what if this ruins everything? What if I lose my academic career before it starts? What if I can't get into graduate school or find work in environmental science or do any of the things I thought I wanted to do with my life?"

"Then you'll do something else. Something that lets you live with the truth of who you are instead of running from it."

"What if I can't find anything like that?"

"Then we'll figure it out together."

The words come out before I can stop them, and I realize as I say them that I mean them completely. Not just the comfort of them, but the commitment underneath. The promise of staying regardless of consequences.

Maya stares at me. "Together?"

"Maya, I'm not going anywhere. Whether you graduate with honors or fail your thesis defense or decide to become a mechanic like me or move to Alaska to work in a fish cannery. I'm staying."

"You can't know that. You can't promise that."

"Yes, I can. Because I already chose. Not just you, but this. The life where we figure things out together instead of alone. The life where we practice choosing each other even when it's hard, especially when it's hard."

Maya is crying again, but it's different now. Not the angry tears of frustration or the guilty tears of confession, but the overwhelmed tears of someone receiving something they didn't know they needed.

"Dylan, what if I keep making wrong choices? What if I disappoint you or hurt you or choose myself over you when it matters?"

"Then we'll deal with it. We'll talk about it and figure out how to do better next time. But I'm not leaving because you're imperfect, Maya. I'm staying because you're imperfect and trying anyway."

She gets up from her chair and comes around to my side of the table, and I pull her down onto my lap, holding her while she cries into my shoulder. The other students in the library probably think we're having a dramatic breakup, but this is the opposite. This is the moment we both stop waiting for the other person to leave.

"I love you," she says into my neck. "Not just because you stay, but because you make staying feel like choosing instead of settling."

"I love you too. And Maya?"

"Yeah?"

"Finish the thesis. The real one. The one that tells the truth about what you did and what you learned and how communities can heal when individuals take responsibility for the harm they've caused. Write it because the world needs more people who are willing to be honest about their failures. Write it because Elena Rodriguez deserves to be remembered for more than just how she died."

Maya pulls back to look at me. "You think I can do it?"

"I think you've already been doing it. Every day for the past six months, every time you choose honesty over comfort, every time you choose to stay present to the consequences of your choices instead of running away. This thesis is just the formal version of work you've already been doing."

She nods, and I can see something settling in her face. Not confidence exactly, but determination. The look of someone who's decided to choose the hard thing because it's also the right thing.

"Will you help me?" she asks.

"How?"

"Read the drafts. Tell me when I'm being too hard on myself and when I'm not being hard enough. Help me find the balance between accountability and self-destruction."

"Yes."

"Will you come to the defense?"

"If you want me to."

"I want you to. I want you to see me defend the hardest thing I've ever written. I want you to witness me choosing to be known completely, even when it's terrifying."

"Then I'll be there."

Maya kisses me, and it tastes like coffee and salt and the particular flavor of relief that comes from deciding to stop running. When she pulls away, she's smiling, and it's the first real smile I've seen from her in weeks.

"Okay," she says. "Let's do this thing."

She opens her laptop again and starts typing, but this time her pen is held like a tool instead of a weapon. This time she's writing toward something instead of away from something.

I stay with her until the library closes at midnight, bringing her dinner from the food trucks outside, making sure she takes breaks to rest her eyes, reading her drafts and pointing out the places where her academic voice gets too distant from her human voice.

Around 11 PM, she looks up from the screen and says, "Dylan, I think I know what the title should be."

"What?"

"'What We Lost in the Flood: An Autoethnographic Study of Moral Injury, Community Resilience, and the Ethics of Survival.'"

"I like it."

"It's honest."

"It's perfect."

And it is. Not because it's comfortable or safe or guaranteed to be well-received, but because it's true. Because it names what happened without trying to soften it or justify it or make it more palatable for academic consumption.

That night, as we walk to the parking lot under stars that look cold and distant and beautiful, Maya takes my hand and says, "Thank you for staying. For all of it. For believing I could do this even when I didn't believe it myself."

"Thank you for letting me. For trusting me with the hardest parts. For choosing to tell the truth even when it would have been easier to lie."

"Thank you for making staying feel like an adventure instead of a compromise."

We drive home through empty streets, and I think about how love changes when you both stop waiting for the other person to leave. How it becomes less desperate and more sure, less about holding on and more about building something together.

Maya falls asleep in the passenger seat, her laptop bag clutched against her chest like armor, and I drive carefully through the night, carrying us both toward a future we're choosing to build together, one honest choice at a time.
