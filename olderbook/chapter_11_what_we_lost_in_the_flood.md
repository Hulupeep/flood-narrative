# Chapter 11: Beginning to Tell the Truth
## Maya's POV - Past Tense

The storage unit smells like cardboard and that particular stillness of things that have been waiting too long. I've been coming here once a month for three years, paying sixty-eight dollars to keep eight watercolor paintings in climate-controlled limbo. The same eight paintings I chose over Mrs. Rodriguez's life.

Dylan stands behind me as I roll up the metal door, and I can feel his presence like warmth from a fire—close enough to comfort, far enough to let me choose my own temperature. This is the first time I've brought anyone here. The first time I've tried to show someone what I saved and what it cost.

The paintings hang on a pegboard wall, each one perfectly spaced, protected by museum-quality glass. My mother's work, her grandmother's memories translated into watercolor: Montecito before the mansions, when it was just oak trees and rattlesnakes and the kind of silence that makes you understand why people used to believe in God.

"They're beautiful," Dylan says, and I can hear in his voice that he means it. Not the polite beautiful people say about other people's art, but the kind of beautiful that makes you stop walking.

"Yes," I say. "They are."

I used to think that justified it. Beauty as salvation, art as redemption. I told myself stories about preserving culture, about saving irreplaceable family history. I got very good at those stories. Good enough to almost believe them.

"Tell me about this one," Dylan says, stopping in front of a painting of the creek that used to run behind what's now the Montecito Country Club. The water in the painting is so clear you can see every stone on the bottom, painted with the kind of attention that comes from actually lying on your stomach in the dirt, actually watching water move over rock for hours until you understand its language.

"My great-grandmother painted that in 1962," I say. "Before they diverted the creek for the golf course. She used to tell my mother that water remembers everything—every stone it's touched, every root it's nourished, every path it's carved. She said that's why floods are so devastating. It's not just water destroying things. It's water remembering a different geography and trying to return to it."

Dylan nods, studying the brushstrokes. "Is that why you study erosion? Because water remembers?"

The question catches me off guard, the way his questions always do. Not because they're difficult, but because they assume I have reasons beyond the ones I tell myself.

"I study erosion because I caused some," I say, surprising us both.

Dylan turns away from the painting to look at me. Really look, the way he did that day in the rain when I first admitted I wasn't okay. "How?"

And then I'm telling him. Not the careful version I've practiced for three years, not the story I tell my therapist or my academic advisor or the concerned relatives who still ask how I'm "processing" the trauma. The real story.

"I was home from college for winter break, in my mother's studio when the evacuation order came. I was eighteen, a senior in high school getting ready to graduate and head to UCSB. My father was outside, helping Mrs. Martinez load her car. My mother was gathering important documents from the house. And I was supposed to be helping Mrs. Rodriguez next door—she was eighty-two and diabetic and couldn't move quickly on the best of days."

My voice sounds strange in the enclosed space, like hearing yourself on a recording. Too loud and too quiet at the same time.

"But the paintings were just sitting there. Eight paintings that took my great-grandmother twelve years to complete. The only record of what Montecito looked like before we paved over it and planted non-native grass and built houses in the debris flow paths because we thought money could buy us safety from geography."

I touch the frame of the creek painting, and the glass is cold under my fingers.

"I could hear Mrs. Rodriguez calling for help. She was on her front porch, and I could see her from the studio window. She had a suitcase and her cat carrier, but she couldn't get down the front steps because the debris flow was already knee-deep and moving fast, carrying mud and boulders."

Dylan doesn't say anything. Doesn't try to comfort me or rush me or make it easier. Just stands there like a harbor, like somewhere you could anchor if you needed to.

"I looked at the paintings. I looked at Mrs. Rodriguez. I looked at the paintings again. And I made a choice."

The words hang in the air like a confession in a church, carrying all the weight they've been holding for three years.

"I chose the paintings. Not because I didn't have time to help her. Not because I thought someone else would. I chose them because I decided that eight watercolors representing three generations of my family's history were more important than one old woman's life."

My voice cracks on the word "life," and I taste salt. I didn't realize I was crying.

"I carried the paintings to my car, one by one, in the rain. Eight trips while Mrs. Rodriguez stood on her porch calling for help. By the time I finished loading them, the debris flow was waist-deep and carrying pieces of trees. By the time I drove to the evacuation center, it was too late to go back."

Dylan's hand finds mine, and his fingers are warm and steady and don't try to fix anything.

"They found her body two days later in what used to be her garden. She was holding a photograph from her wallet—my high school graduation picture. She kept it with her even when she was dying."

The storage unit is very quiet. Even the fluorescent light has stopped its electric humming.

"My father said she loved me like a granddaughter. And she did. She brought me homemade tamales every Christmas and remembered my birthday and asked about my college applications like I was her own family. And I let her die so I could save paintings."

I'm sobbing now, the kind of crying that comes from someplace deeper than sadness. The kind that makes you understand why people talk about breaking down—because something that was holding you upright has finally given way.

Dylan doesn't try to stop me from crying or tell me it's not my fault or offer any of the comfortable lies people have been feeding me for six years. He just holds my hand and lets me break down in a storage unit surrounded by the things I chose over human life.

When the crying finally stops, I feel empty in a way that's not entirely terrible. Like a house after you've finally thrown away all the broken furniture you kept thinking you might repair someday.

"How long have you been carrying that alone?" Dylan asks.

"Six years, four months, and sixteen days."

"Jesus, Maya."

"I know."

"No, I mean—" He stops, looks around the storage unit like he's seeing it for the first time. "You've been coming here once a month for six years. Paying to visit the things you saved. Like a shrine."

I hadn't thought of it that way, but he's right. This isn't storage. It's penance.

"What would you choose now?" he asks. "If you could go back. If you had to choose again."

The answer comes without hesitation, surprising me with its certainty.

"You," I say. "I would choose you."

And I realize as I say it that this is the first time I've ever been sure about choosing a person over a thing, a future over a past, love over fear.

"What if I leave too?" Dylan asks, and his voice is smaller than I've ever heard it.

"Then I'll practice staying."

He looks at me for a long moment, and I can see him deciding whether to believe me. Whether to trust that someone who chose paintings over people might have learned to choose differently.

"I've never been anyone's first choice," he says finally.

"You are now."

We stand there in the storage unit surrounded by beautiful watercolors and ugly truths, and I understand that this is what love looks like after you've learned what it costs. Not the easy love that grows in perfect conditions, but the kind that takes root in disturbed soil, in the space between what you've lost and what you've found.

"I want to donate them," I say suddenly. "The paintings. To the historical society or the library or somewhere people can see them without them belonging to anyone."

Dylan nods. "Good."

"But first I want to write something. About how they were saved and what their salvation cost. About Mrs. Rodriguez and the choice I made and what I've learned about the weight of choosing."

"Also good."

"Will you help me write it?"

"If you want."

"I want."

And for the first time in six years, four months, and sixteen days, I want something more than I fear the consequences of having it.
