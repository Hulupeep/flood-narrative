# Chapter 13: The Second Flood
## Maya's POV - Past Tense

Dr. Vance's office smells like coffee and the particular silence of academic buildings on Sunday afternoons. I've been sitting here for ten minutes, staring at the revised abstract for my senior thesis, and I still can't make myself read it out loud. Even though Dylan is here, even though I've already told him the worst thing about myself, even though saying it out loud to my academic advisor should feel easy after confessing to the person I love.

But this is different. This is making it official. This is choosing to let my choice become part of the academic record, part of how I'm understood professionally, part of who I am when I'm not protected by privacy or love or the careful distance I've maintained between my trauma and my scholarship.

"Maya?" Dr. Vance sets down her coffee cup and looks at me with the patient attention that made me trust her in the first place. "Would you like to read the revised abstract, or would you prefer I do it?"

Dylan sits in the corner chair, not quite part of the official meeting but not entirely separate from it either. He's been carrying a notebook lately—not one of his hidden observation journals, but a new one we started together. For writing down the things we notice when we're learning to choose each other. Right now he's writing something, and I wonder if it's about how I look when I'm trying to decide whether to be brave.

"I'll read it," I say.

The paper feels heavier than it should in my hands, like the words have accumulated weight over the months I've been revising them, moving closer and closer to truth.

"'Community Resilience in Post-Disaster Recovery: A Case Study of the January 9, 2018 Montecito Debris Flows with Researcher Personal Involvement.'" I pause, swallow. "'This study examines patterns of psychological and social recovery following the Montecito mudslides, with particular attention to how individual moral choices during crisis events affect long-term community healing. The researcher's direct involvement in the disaster provides both insight and limitation to the analysis, as the researcher was present during the evacuation and made choices that resulted in casualty outcomes.'"

Dr. Vance nods encouragingly, but I can see the question in her face. I've been dancing around the edges of personal involvement for two years now, never quite explaining what "direct involvement" means.

"The methodology section," I continue, "includes interviews with seventeen Montecito residents, analysis of emergency response records, and researcher autoethnography examining the psychological impact of moral injury during natural disasters. The researcher's personal experience includes making a conscious choice to prioritize material preservation over human assistance during the evacuation, resulting in the death of Elena Rodriguez, age 82, who lived adjacent to the researcher's family home."

The silence in the office is different from the comfortable academic quiet that usually lives here. This is the silence of information being processed, of someone you respect learning something about you that changes how they see you.

Dylan's pen has stopped moving across his notebook page.

"The findings section," I read, my voice getting steadier now that the worst part is out, "suggests that community resilience is significantly impacted by the individual choices made during crisis events, and that healing requires not only collective support systems but also individual accountability and the integration of moral injury into personal and community narratives."

I set the paper down and look at Dr. Vance, who is looking at me with an expression I can't read.

"Maya," she says carefully, "this is significantly different from your previous draft."

"Yes."

"May I ask what prompted this revision?"

I glance at Dylan, who gives me the smallest nod—not pushing, just reminding me that I'm not alone in this room, that someone already knows the worst thing about me and is still here.

"I've been lying," I say. "Not completely, but enough. I've been studying disaster recovery as if I were an objective observer when I'm actually someone who caused part of the disaster that needs recovering from."

Dr. Vance leans forward. "Tell me about Elena Rodriguez."

And so I do. Not the careful academic version, not the version designed to minimize my culpability or maximize my victimhood. The real version.

"She was my neighbor. Had been since I was seven years old. She made me tres leches cake every birthday and remembered when I got my acceptance letter to UCSB and asked about my college applications when I came home for winter break. She was diabetic and lived alone except for her cat, Mr. Whiskers, who was orange and fat and slept in her front window every afternoon."

I'm not looking at Dr. Vance anymore. I'm looking at my hands, at Dylan's notebook, at the diploma on the wall—anything but the face of someone who trusted me to be the kind of student who deserved mentorship.

"When the evacuation order came during my winter break from high school, my father was helping our other neighbor, Mrs. Martinez, load her car. My mother was gathering documents from the house. I was supposed to help Mrs. Rodriguez because she was the oldest person on our street and the least able to evacuate quickly on her own."

My throat feels thick, but I keep talking.

"But I was in my mother's art studio, looking at my great-grandmother's watercolor paintings. Eight paintings that represented three generations of my family's history in Montecito. Irreplaceable documentation of what the area looked like before development. And I could hear Mrs. Rodriguez calling for help, but I could also see the debris flow rising in her yard, and I made a calculation."

Dr. Vance is very still, listening with the complete attention she gives to student presentations, but this isn't a presentation. This is a confession.

"I calculated that someone else would probably help her. That the paintings would definitely be destroyed if I didn't save them immediately. That my family would never forgive me if I let three generations of our history wash away. That Mrs. Rodriguez was old anyway, and the paintings were young, and permanence should be preserved over temporary life."

The words taste like poison, but I keep saying them because this is what honesty looks like when you stop trying to make it palatable.

"So I chose the paintings. I made eight trips from the studio to my car, carrying watercolors while I could hear Mrs. Rodriguez getting more and more desperate on her front porch. By the time I finished loading the paintings, the debris flow was too deep and fast for me to reach her safely. By the time the evacuation was complete, she was dead."

I finally look up at Dr. Vance, who is looking at me with something I recognize from Dylan's face when I first told him about the flood. Not judgment, not pity, but the careful attention of someone trying to understand the full shape of a truth they've been given.

"They found her body in her garden two days later. She was holding a photograph—my high school graduation picture that she kept in her wallet. Even when she was dying, she was thinking about the people she loved."

Dr. Vance sets down her pen. "Maya, why are you telling me this now?"

"Because I want my thesis to be about what actually happened, not what I wish had happened. Because I've spent six years studying disaster recovery as a way to avoid dealing with disaster causation. Because you asked me two years ago what I was really trying to understand, and the answer is: I'm trying to understand how good people make terrible choices and whether they can still be good people afterward."

"And what have you concluded?"

I look at Dylan, who is watching me with eyes that hold no judgment, only love and the steady presence that taught me it was possible to be known completely and chosen anyway.

"I think the question is wrong," I say. "I think the right question is: how do people who've made terrible choices learn to make better ones? How do you build something meaningful from the wreckage of who you thought you were?"

Dr. Vance nods slowly. "And how do you answer that question?"

"You practice," I say. "You practice choosing differently. You practice telling the truth about what you chose before. You practice staying present to the consequences of your choices instead of running away from them. And you practice letting people love you even after they know the worst thing about you."

I reach over and take Dylan's hand, and he squeezes my fingers like an anchor.

"You practice choosing people over things, future over past, love over safety. And you accept that you might choose wrong again, but you choose anyway, because choosing nothing is just another way of choosing wrong."

Dr. Vance is quiet for a long moment, and I can see her adjusting her understanding of me, filing away the student she thought she knew and trying to understand the one sitting in front of her now.

"This will change your thesis completely," she says finally.

"I know."

"The methodology will need to be entirely restructured. The ethics approval process will be complex. You'll essentially be starting over with four months until your defense."

"I know."

"Why now? Why not continue with the less personal approach and save this revelation for future research?"

I think about this question, which is really asking why I'm choosing the harder path when an easier one is available. Why I'm choosing transparency when I could choose protection.

"Because Dylan asked me what I would choose if I had to choose again," I say. "And I realized that I'm choosing every day. Every day I choose whether to tell the truth or maintain the comfortable lie. Every day I choose whether to use my research to understand what happened or to avoid what happened. Every day I choose whether to let my guilt make me smaller or let my responsibility make me better."

I look at Dr. Vance directly. "And I want to choose better. Even if it's harder. Even if it means starting over. Even if it means people knowing the worst thing about me."

Dr. Vance smiles, and it's the first smile I've seen from her that includes sadness. "Maya, this is probably the most honest piece of academic work I've encountered in fifteen years of advising students."

"Is that good?"

"That's rare. And difficult. And important."

She picks up her pen again. "Let's talk about how to structure autoethnography in disaster studies. Let's talk about ethics approval for research that includes personal moral injury. Let's talk about how to write about Elena Rodriguez in a way that honors her memory while serving your research goals."

And we do. We spend the next two hours completely restructuring my thesis, building a new methodology around truth-telling, creating a framework for studying disaster recovery when you're also studying disaster participation.

Dylan stays the entire time, occasionally contributing an observation or asking a question that helps clarify my thinking. But mostly he just writes in our shared notebook, documenting the process of watching someone you love choose courage over comfort.

When we finally leave Dr. Vance's office, the sun is setting over campus, and the winter air tastes like rain coming.

"How do you feel?" Dylan asks as we walk toward the parking lot.

"Terrified," I say. "And relieved. And like I just jumped off a cliff but I'm not sure if I'm falling or flying."

"Flying," Dylan says with certainty. "Definitely flying."

I stop walking and look at him. "How can you be sure?"

"Because falling is what happens when you don't choose. Flying is what happens when you choose the scary thing because it's also the right thing."

He's right. This feels like flying—the kind of terrifying freedom that comes from finally telling the truth about who you are, even when who you are includes choices you can't undo and consequences you can't escape.

"Dylan?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for being here. For all of it."

"Thank you for letting me."

We get in the car and drive home through the beginnings of the first real storm of the season, and I don't flinch when the windshield wipers start their rhythmic sweep across the glass. I just listen to the sound of water finding its way, and I think about how sometimes the second flood—the one that washes away all your careful constructions and forces you to rebuild from honesty—is the one that saves you.
