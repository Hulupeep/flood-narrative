# Chapter 12: His Own Revelations
## Dylan's POV - Present Tense

Maya's truth sits between us in my garage like a third person, uninvited but impossible to ignore. She's been here for two hours now, helping me rebuild a carburetor that doesn't actually need rebuilding, and we're both pretending this is about automotive maintenance instead of what it actually is: her learning to be around someone who knows the worst thing about her and hasn't left yet.

I watch her hands as she cleans the float bowl, precise and careful the way she does everything now, like she's afraid of breaking something else. She's told me about the flood, about Mrs. Rodriguez, about the paintings she chose over a human life. She's told me, and she's waiting for me to decide what that makes her.

The problem is, I already decided three years ago.

"Dylan?" She looks up from the carburetor parts spread across my workbench like the pieces of something that used to run.

"Yeah?"

"Say something. Please."

I set down the screwdriver I've been holding without using. "What do you want me to say?"

"That I'm a terrible person. That you can't look at me the same way. That you need time to think about whether you can be with someone who..." She stops, shakes her head. "Just say something real."

Real. Maya asks for real like it's something I've been holding back, but the truth is I've been giving her real since the day I first saw her flinch at the sound of water hitting pavement. The problem isn't that I won't be real with her. The problem is that real includes things I've never told anyone.

"You want to know what I think?" I ask.

She nods, bracing herself.

"I think you've been punishing yourself for three years for making a choice that most people would have made in the same situation. I think you've convinced yourself you're a monster because it's easier than forgiving yourself for being human."

Maya stares at me. "Dylan, I let someone die."

"Yeah. You did."

She flinches like I've hit her, and I realize she was expecting me to soften it, to find some way to make it not true.

"But that's not the whole story," I continue. "You were eighteen years old in the middle of a natural disaster. You had thirty seconds to make a choice that would have been impossible for anyone. You made the wrong choice. And you've been trying to make it right ever since."

"That doesn't make it okay."

"No," I agree. "It doesn't make it okay. It makes it human."

Maya's hands are shaking as she sets down the carburetor float. "How can you say that?"

"Because I've made my own wrong choices. Because I know what it looks like to choose the thing that feels safe over the thing that's right. Because I recognize the look of someone who's been carrying guilt that's too heavy for one person to carry alone."

I've never said this out loud before. Never even let myself think it clearly. But Maya's honesty deserves honesty in return.

"What did you choose wrong?" she asks.

I look around my garage—neat and organized and temporary, everything I own fitting into boxes that could be packed in fifteen minutes. The life of someone who's always ready to leave because leaving got easier than staying after a while.

"My father," I say. "When I was twelve."

Maya waits. She's learned patience from me, but I learned it from necessity—from being the kid who had to wait for adults to decide whether they wanted to keep trying to love him.

"There was a flood in Fresno the winter I turned twelve. Not like your flood—no one died, just a lot of property damage. But our apartment was in the basement of this old house, and when the water came, we had about ten minutes to get out."

I can still remember the sound of my mother crying as she threw things into garbage bags—photos, my sister's stuffed animals, the few pieces of jewelry she'd inherited from her mother. My father standing in the doorway with his hands in his pockets, watching like a man observing someone else's emergency.

"My mom was trying to save everything. All these things that meant something to her but wouldn't matter if we were dead. And my dad just stood there. Not helping, not hurrying, just watching her try to hold onto a life he'd already decided to walk away from."

Maya's hands are still now, the carburetor forgotten.

"I could have helped her. Could have carried things to the car, could have tried to save some of what mattered to her. But I was twelve and scared and I looked at my father not helping and I thought: if he doesn't care, why should I?"

The words taste like rust in my mouth.

"So I just stood there too. Watching my mother try to save our life by herself while me and my father acted like spectators to our own evacuation."

Maya reaches across the workbench and touches my hand. Her fingers are stained with carburetor cleaner and warm despite the December cold seeping through the garage walls.

"What happened?"

"We lost everything. Photos, furniture, clothes, all of it. Had to move in with my mom's sister until she could find work and save enough for a deposit on a new place. My father stayed for another six months, long enough to make sure we were okay. Then he left. Said the flood made him realize he wasn't meant for family life."

I laugh, but it comes out bitter. "Funny thing is, I don't think it was the flood that made him realize that. I think it was watching me choose not to help. Watching me become him."

"Dylan." Maya's voice is soft. "You were twelve years old."

"Same age as some of the kids who died in your flood. Same age as kids who do help, who do choose right when it matters. Age doesn't excuse everything."

"But you were a child watching your father model how to behave in a crisis. That's different than being an adult making your own choice."

I shake my head. "Is it? Because I've been making the same choice ever since. Choosing not to help when helping gets complicated. Choosing to keep my distance so I don't have to choose between saving myself and saving someone else."

Maya is quiet for a long moment, and I can see her processing this, rearranging what she thought she knew about me.

"Is that why you work maintenance?" she asks. "Fixing things but never owning them?"

"Maybe. Probably." I trace the edge of the workbench with my finger. "I fix broken things for other people because it feels like making amends. But I don't let myself have things that could be taken away. Don't let myself care about people who might need me to choose them over my own safety."

"But you chose me," Maya says. "You keep choosing me."

"Yeah. I do."

"Even though I might need you to choose me over your safety."

"Especially because of that."

She looks at me with something I've never seen in her face before. Not gratitude or surprise or pity. Recognition.

"We're both trying to make up for the wrong choice," she says.

"Maybe. Or maybe we're just trying to learn how to make the right one next time."

Maya picks up the carburetor float again, turns it over in her hands like she's examining it for cracks. "What would you choose now? If your mom needed help and your dad was watching?"

"I'd help her. Without question."

"Even if it meant choosing sides?"

"Especially if it meant choosing sides."

She nods. "What would you choose if you had to pick between staying safe and staying with me?"

"You. Every time."

"What if staying with me meant giving up the life you've built? The safety of being able to leave?"

"Maya." I wait until she looks at me. "I already gave that up. The day I decided to care about someone who flinches at the sound of water and keeps emergency supplies in her backpack and studies erosion like it's a language she's trying to learn. I gave up safe the moment I fell in love with you."

Her breath catches. It's the first time I've said it out loud, the first time either of us has used that word. But it's been true for months now, maybe since the day I first fixed her door handle and realized I wanted to fix everything that was broken in her world.

"You love me?" she asks.

"Yeah. I love you."

"Even knowing what I chose?"

"Especially knowing what you chose. Because it means you understand what choosing costs. Because it means when you choose me, you know what you're choosing."

Maya sets down the carburetor float and walks around the workbench to where I'm standing. She's crying again, but it's different this time. Not the breakdown crying from the storage unit, but the kind of tears that come when something that's been broken for a long time finally starts to heal.

"I love you too," she says. "And I'm scared about how much I mean it."

"Good," I say, pulling her close. "I'm scared too."

We stand there in my garage surrounded by the tools I use to fix other people's broken things, and I understand that this is what love looks like when you've both learned what it costs to choose wrong. Not the easy love that happens when everything is perfect, but the careful love that grows in the space between guilt and forgiveness, between what you've done and who you're trying to become.

"Dylan?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for telling me about your father. About the choice you made."

"Thank you for trusting me with yours."

She pulls back to look at me. "What do we do now?"

"Now we practice choosing each other. Every day. Until it stops feeling scary and starts feeling like home."

"What if we choose wrong again?"

"Then we choose right the next time. And the time after that. Until we get good at it."

Maya smiles, and it's the first smile I've seen from her that doesn't look like it's hiding something. "I like that plan."

"Good. Because it's the only plan I've got."

We go back to rebuilding the carburetor that doesn't need rebuilding, but now we're not pretending it's about automotive maintenance. We're practicing the daily work of loving someone when you both know what love can cost, when you both understand that choosing each other is something you have to do over and over again, not just once.

Outside, it starts to rain—the first real rain of the season—and Maya doesn't flinch. She just looks toward the garage door and listens to the sound of water finding its way back to the earth.

"It sounds different now," she says.

"Different how?"

"Less like an ending. More like a beginning."

And I think maybe that's what love is after you've learned to choose it consciously: the sound of water finding a new course, carving something beautiful from disturbed ground.
