# Chapter 9 - Maya

The morning after I told Dylan about Mrs. Rodriguez, I woke up feeling like I had been excavated. Not emptied—excavated. Like layers of careful sediment had been removed to reveal something that had been buried but not destroyed.

Elena was already gone when I got up, which was probably for the best. I wasn't ready to explain why I looked like I had been crying, or why there was mud on my jeans from sitting on basement stairs at three in the morning, or why I felt simultaneously lighter and more fragile than I had in years.

I made coffee and sat at our kitchen table, looking out at a campus that had been transformed by two days of rain. Storm drains backed up, walkways partially flooded, maintenance crews working to pump water out of buildings where it didn't belong. The whole infrastructure struggling to manage more than it was designed to handle.

Like me, I thought. Like all of us, trying to function around damage we weren't built to carry.

My phone buzzed with a text from Dylan: *basement's been pumped. equipment replacement starts today. you okay?*

I stared at the message for a long time before responding: *different kind of okay than before.*

His response came immediately: *better or worse?*

*don't know yet. maybe just more honest.*

*honest is good. scary but good.*

I put the phone down and tried to imagine what Elena would say if I told her what I had told Dylan. She would want to analyze it, probably. Help me understand the psychological mechanisms that led to my choice, the trauma responses that had shaped my behavior since. She would be kind and careful and therapeutic, and she would try to help me forgive myself.

But Dylan hadn't tried to help me forgive myself. He had listened to what I did, acknowledged that it was terrible, and then chosen to stay anyway. Not because he thought I deserved forgiveness, but because he thought I deserved accompaniment while I figured out how to live with what I had done.

The difference felt revolutionary.

I spent the morning reading for my coastal dynamics class, but the academic language that usually soothed me felt different now. *Debris flow*, *catastrophic failure*, *threshold conditions*—I still understood these terms technically, but I no longer needed them to create distance between myself and what they described.

I had told someone the truth about what happened in the flood. I had used plain language: *I chose paintings over a person who loved me*. And the world had not ended. Dylan had not left. The ground had not opened up to swallow me.

Instead, something that had been clenched tight in my chest for four years had loosened just enough for me to breathe differently.

Around noon, I found myself walking across campus toward the Environmental Science building. Not because I had classes there—my Tuesday schedule was clear—but because I needed to see the place where I had broken down and been witnessed, where I had practiced radical honesty and discovered it was survivable.

The basement had been pumped out, like Dylan said. Maintenance crews were moving damaged equipment, replacing computers, mopping floors. The kind of systematic repair work that happens after water goes where it's not supposed to go.

I stood at the top of the stairs where Dylan had found me, and tried to remember exactly how it felt to carry the story alone. But the memory was already changing, becoming something that belonged to both of us instead of just to me.

"Maya?"

I turned to find Dr. Vance walking toward me, carrying a box of water-damaged research materials.

"I heard about the flooding," she said. "Were you here when it happened?"

"Late last night. I came to study and found water in the basement."

Dr. Vance set down her box and looked at me with the particular kind of attention she used when she was reading between the lines of what students told her.

"Are you okay? I know floods can be... triggering for people who've experienced them before."

The word *triggering* hung between us like an invitation. Dr. Vance knew about the Montecito flood—it was in my file, part of my academic record. She had been waiting for four years for me to connect my research interests to my personal experience, to acknowledge that I was studying the same forces that had shaped my trauma.

For four years, I had deflected these invitations with academic language and careful distance. But standing in the place where I had told Dylan the truth, I found myself considering what it would look like to tell Dr. Vance a version of it too.

"Dr. Vance," I said. "Can I ask you something about trauma and memory?"

"Of course."

"If someone remembers everything about a traumatic event—every detail, every choice, every consequence—does that mean they processed it properly? Or does it mean they're stuck in it?"

Dr. Vance tilted her head, the way she did when students asked questions that revealed more than they intended.

"That's a complex question. Perfect recall of trauma can sometimes indicate that the person hasn't been able to integrate the experience into their broader narrative. They remember everything because they haven't found a way to metabolize it."

"What does metabolizing trauma look like?"

"Usually it involves being able to tell the story of what happened without being overwhelmed by it. Being able to understand your own actions in context, rather than judging them by impossible standards."

I thought about this. About the difference between the story I had been telling myself—*I am a bad person who did a selfish thing*—and the story Dylan had offered—*You were afraid and made a human choice in an impossible situation*.

"What if," I said carefully, "someone did something during a trauma that they can't forgive themselves for? Something that resulted in harm to another person?"

Dr. Vance's expression softened. "Maya, are we still talking hypothetically?"

I looked down at the basement where water had pooled and been pumped out, where damage had been assessed and repair had begun. Where systems had failed and been rebuilt to handle future failures better.

"No," I said. "We're not talking hypothetically."

Dr. Vance glanced around the hallway, then gestured toward her office. "Would you like to talk somewhere more private?"

I followed her to the small office she shared with another advisor, walls lined with books about environmental policy and climate change adaptation. She closed the door and settled across from me, creating the kind of space that invited honesty.

"Tell me about the Montecito flood," she said.

So I did. Not the whole story—I wasn't ready to tell anyone except Dylan about Mrs. Rodriguez yet—but enough. About waking up to disaster, about having fifteen minutes to choose what mattered, about the weight of paintings in my arms and the sound of water where it didn't belong.

About spending four years studying coastal erosion as a form of intellectual penance, trying to understand the forces that had revealed who I really was when everything failed.

"Maya," Dr. Vance said when I finished. "You've been carrying this alone for four years."

"Yes."

"That must have been exhausting."

The simple acknowledgment of exhaustion hit me harder than questions about trauma or healing. I had been exhausted. Tired from the constant work of managing my own narrative, of studying disaster from a distance, of pretending that my research interests were purely academic.

Tired from calling maintenance to fix windows that weren't broken because I needed company more than I needed functional latches.

Tired from loving Elena while keeping the most important part of myself hidden from her.

Tired from carrying the weight of one choice for four years, letting it define everything about who I thought I was allowed to become.

"Yeah," I said. "It has been."

"Have you considered," Dr. Vance said gently, "that your research might be serving a different purpose than you think? That studying coastal resilience and disaster recovery might be your way of learning how communities—and individuals—can rebuild after catastrophic loss?"

I had not considered this. I had been so focused on my research as self-punishment that I hadn't recognized it might also be self-healing. Learning how systems adapt after failure, how infrastructure gets rebuilt to handle future challenges, how communities develop resilience through understanding their vulnerabilities.

"Maybe," I said.

"Your senior thesis," Dr. Vance continued. "What if instead of approaching it as purely academic research, you approached it as applied research? Studying recovery and resilience in your own community, using your own experience as both subject and researcher?"

The suggestion was terrifying and compelling in equal measure. The idea of claiming my experience instead of hiding from it, of using my understanding of disaster to help others prepare for or recover from similar experiences.

Of transforming the thing that had been drowning me into something that might help others learn to swim.

"I don't know if I'm ready for that," I said.

"You don't have to decide now. But Maya—you have insights about disaster and recovery that you can't get from textbooks. You understand in your body what it feels like when systems fail, what it costs to rebuild, what resilience actually requires."

I left Dr. Vance's office with my head spinning and my chest still feeling excavated, but in a way that suggested new growth rather than just empty space.

I walked back across campus thinking about the difference between studying something to understand it and studying something to distance yourself from it. About the possibility that my four years of environmental science education had been both penance and preparation, both avoidance and approach.

About Dylan, who understood that fixing things sometimes meant working around damage rather than pretending it didn't exist.

That afternoon, I did something I hadn't done in four years: I called my mother.

"Maya?" Her voice was surprised, cautious. We talked maybe once a month, careful conversations about school and weather and anything except the thing that had changed all of us.

"Mom," I said. "I need to ask you about the paintings."

Silence on the other end of the line. Long enough that I wondered if she had hung up.

"Which paintings?" she asked finally, though we both knew which paintings.

"The ones I saved. The ones from your studio."

"What about them?"

"Are you angry that I saved them?"

Another silence. Longer this time.

"Maya," my mother said. "I need you to understand something. I was never angry that you saved the paintings. I was angry that saving them cost you so much."

The words hit me like cold water. Four years of assuming my mother was disappointed in my choice, and she had been worried about its effect on me.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean you've been carrying guilt about those paintings since the night of the flood. You've been punishing yourself for choosing them, when the truth is—Maya, I would have saved them too."

"What?"

"If I had been in that studio, if I had fifteen minutes to choose what mattered most, I would have saved those paintings too. Not because they're worth more than people, but because they represent something that can't be recreated. My mother's work, my grandmother's memories, our family's history in this place."

I sat down on a bench outside the library, feeling like the ground was shifting under my feet.

"But Mrs. Rodriguez—"

"Mrs. Rodriguez would have understood," my mother said quietly. "She would have understood because she loved you like family, and family protects what connects them to who they are."

"How can you say that?"

"Because I knew Elena Rodriguez for thirty years. Because she used to come over for coffee and ask about my paintings, about my mother's work, about the stories they told. Because she understood that some things, once they're lost, can never be recovered."

I found myself crying again, but these were different tears. Not the practiced, efficient crying I had perfected over four years of guilt, but something messier and more relieving.

"Maya," my mother continued. "The reason I stopped painting after the flood wasn't because you saved the paintings. It was because I couldn't bear the thought that you might carry guilt about them for the rest of your life."

"I don't understand."

"I stopped painting because every time I picked up a brush, I thought about you standing in that studio, making an impossible choice in impossible circumstances. I thought about how that choice was going to define how you saw yourself, and I couldn't create anything new while you were drowning in regret about what you preserved."

The conversation continued for another twenty minutes, my mother telling me things she should have said four years ago, me telling her things I should have asked instead of assuming. We talked about guilt and grief and the difference between mourning what was lost and regretting what was saved.

When I hung up, I felt like I had been given a different story to carry. Not the story of a selfish girl who chose objects over people, but the story of an eighteen-year-old who tried to preserve something irreplaceable in fifteen minutes of chaos.

Still a tragedy. Still a choice with consequences I would carry forever. But a human tragedy, a human choice, made by someone who was doing her best with information she didn't have time to process.

That evening, I called Dylan.

"How are you doing?" he asked immediately.

"Different," I said. "Better, I think. Definitely different."

"Good different or scary different?"

"Both. I talked to Dr. Vance today. And my mother. About the flood."

"How did that go?"

"Like excavation. Like finding out that some of the stories I've been telling myself aren't actually true."

Dylan was quiet for a moment. "Want to talk about it?"

"Actually," I said, surprising myself, "I want to show you something. Are you free tomorrow afternoon?"

"I'm always free for you."

The simplicity of his answer, the lack of questions or conditions, made me understand why I had called him at three in the morning when I found water where it shouldn't be. Dylan didn't just show up when I needed him—he made himself available for whatever I needed him for.

"I want to take you to see the paintings," I said. "The ones I saved. They're in storage in Santa Barbara."

"You sure?"

"No. But I want to do it anyway."

"Okay. I'll pick you up at two."

After I hung up, I sat in my kitchen and thought about excavation. About the difference between being emptied and being revealed. About the possibility that carrying the weight of one choice for four years had built strength I didn't know I had.

About love, which doesn't require you to be perfect, just to be honest about your imperfections.

About Dylan, who was teaching me that some damage doesn't need to be fixed, just acknowledged and worked around.

About my mother, who had stopped creating art because she couldn't bear for me to feel guilty about the art I had saved.

About Mrs. Rodriguez, who my mother said would have understood why I made the choice I made.

I still didn't know if I could forgive myself for that choice. But for the first time in four years, I was beginning to understand that forgiveness might not be the point.

The point might be learning to carry the weight without letting it crush me. Learning to tell the story without drowning in it. Learning to love people who could see my damage and choose to stay anyway.

Learning to rebuild, not from scratch, but from what remained after the flood.
