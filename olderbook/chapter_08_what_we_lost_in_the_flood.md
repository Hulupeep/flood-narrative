# Chapter 8 - Dylan

The call comes at 3:17 AM on Tuesday, October fifteenth. My phone buzzing against the wood crate I use as a nightstand, the sound cutting through the October rain that's been falling for two days straight.

"Dylan?" Maya's voice is small, far away. Background noise like she's calling from inside something hollow.

"Where are you?"

"Campus. I... there's water in the Environmental Science building. In the basement lab. It's not supposed to be there."

I sit up, already reaching for my jeans. "Are you okay?"

"I don't know. I came here to study for my exam tomorrow, but the door was propped open and I could hear water running, so I went to check and—Dylan, there's so much water."

Her voice breaks on the word *water*, and I understand that whatever's happening isn't really about a flooded basement.

"Stay where you are," I say. "I'm coming."

I drive across town through rain that makes the streetlights look like they're underwater, through intersections where storm drains are backing up and sending streams across the asphalt. The radio's playing emergency alerts about flash flood warnings, but the language is careful and bureaucratic: *monitor conditions*, *avoid low-lying areas*, *use caution*.

The kind of language that tries to make uncontrollable things sound manageable.

I find Maya in Bren Hall, sitting on the stairs leading down to the basement level. She's wearing the gray sweater and jeans that are soaked to the knees, her hair dripping onto her notebook. When I sit down beside her, I can feel her shaking.

"How long have you been here?" I ask.

"I don't know. A while."

Below us, I can hear water moving. Not the steady drip of a broken pipe, but the sound of water finding its way through spaces it's not supposed to occupy. Flowing, settling, rising.

"Maya, what happened?"

She looks at me, and her face is pale in the fluorescent light. "I came here to study because I couldn't sleep. The rain was too loud in my apartment, and Elena kept asking if I was okay, and I just... I needed somewhere quiet. But when I got here, the basement door was propped open and I could hear water."

"So you went to check."

"I went to check." She laughs, but it doesn't sound like humor. "Like I could do anything about it. Like I know how to stop water once it starts moving."

I stand up and walk to the basement entrance. The door is propped open with a rubber wedge, and I can see water covering the floor, maybe three inches deep. Not deep enough to be dangerous, but deep enough to damage equipment, computers, research materials. Deep enough to trigger whatever memories Maya carries about water in places it shouldn't be.

"Did you call Physical Plant?" I ask.

"You're Physical Plant."

"I mean the emergency line."

Maya shakes her head. "I called you."

The simplicity of this statement hits me harder than it should. She found water where it didn't belong, and instead of calling the people whose job it is to handle emergencies, she called me. Because I fix things. Because I show up.

Because she trusts me to know the difference between problems that can be solved and problems that can only be witnessed.

I walk back to where she's sitting and settle beside her again. Close enough that she can feel my presence, far enough away that she doesn't feel trapped.

"Tell me about the flood," I say.

"Which one?"

"The one you're thinking about right now."

Maya closes her notebook, though she wasn't actually reading it. Just holding it like something solid to anchor to.

"Montecito," she says. "January ninth, 2018. I was eighteen."

I wait. This is what I've learned about Maya—she needs space to find her way to the truth, like water needs time to find the lowest places.

"It wasn't supposed to be a flood," she says. "It was supposed to be rain. Heavy rain, but just rain. The meteorologists kept talking about 'substantial precipitation' and 'saturated soil conditions,' but they made it sound manageable. Predictable."

"But it wasn't."

"No. It wasn't."

Maya stares down at the water in the basement, and I can see her remembering something else. Something that makes her shoulders tense and her breathing shallow.

"At 3:15 AM, my father started shouting. 'Get up, get up, we have to go.' I could hear sirens outside, and this sound like... like the earth moving. Groaning. And I looked out my bedroom window and saw water coming down the hillside, but it wasn't water anymore. It was mud and trees and pieces of other people's houses."

Her voice gets quieter as she talks, like she's trying not to wake something up.

"My dad said we had fifteen minutes to grab what we could and get to higher ground. Fifteen minutes to choose what mattered enough to save."

"What did you choose?"

Maya is quiet for so long I think she's not going to answer. Below us, the water keeps moving, finding its way into corners and under equipment and around obstacles that can't stop it.

"My mother had a studio in the back of the house," she says finally. "Forty years of paintings. Watercolors of Montecito from before development, botanical studies from when my great-grandmother first moved to California. Family history painted on paper."

"You saved the paintings."

"I saved eight of them. All I could carry." Maya's voice is flat now, factual. "I stood in the studio with water rising around my ankles, and I chose eight paintings to represent forty years of my family's creative work."

This isn't the whole story. I can tell by the way she's holding herself, by the careful neutrality of her voice. But it's more than she's told anyone else, and I understand that she's testing whether I can handle partial truth before she risks complete honesty.

"That must have been an impossible choice," I say.

"It should have been."

The words hang between us like a confession. Maya looks at me to see if I understand what she's really saying: that choosing which paintings to save should have been impossible, but it wasn't. That she made the choice quickly, decisively, without the paralysis that should have come with such weight.

"Maya," I say. "What else were you choosing between?"

She closes her eyes. When she opens them, they're focused on the water below us, but I know she's seeing something else. Somewhere else. Some other choice made in rising water.

"Mrs. Rodriguez lived next door," she says. "Eighty-three years old. Her house was downhill from ours, closer to the creek that turned into a river that turned into a wall of mud and debris."

"She was calling for help."

It's not a question. I know from the way Maya's voice changes, from the way her whole body seems to contract around some central wound.

"She was calling my name. 'Maya, mija, are you safe?' Not asking me to help her—asking if I was safe. Because that's who she was. Even when her own house was flooding, she was worried about the teenager next door."

Maya's hands are shaking now. I want to reach for them, but I understand that physical comfort might interrupt whatever courage she's finding to tell me this story.

"I heard her voice," Maya says. "I was standing in my mother's studio with eight paintings in my arms, and I heard Mrs. Rodriguez calling, and I... I chose the paintings."

The confession sits between us like broken glass. Sharp, impossible to ignore, dangerous to handle without care.

"I stood there for thirty seconds," Maya continues, "with water rising around my ankles, and I calculated. Mrs. Rodriguez has other neighbors. Mrs. Rodriguez might already be safe. These paintings are irreplaceable. My family's history is irreplaceable."

"And?"

"And I chose to save objects instead of helping a person who loved me like a granddaughter." Maya's voice breaks completely now. "Mrs. Rodriguez died in the flood. They found her body two days later in what used to be her garden. And I saved eight watercolor paintings that my mother hasn't looked at since."

The story settles around us like sediment. Heavy, permanent, reshaping the landscape of everything I thought I knew about Maya.

But what surprises me is that I'm not surprised. Not by the choice she made, but by the fact that she's been carrying this alone for four years. Studying coastal erosion like penance, calling maintenance to fix windows that aren't broken, learning to live with water damage that extends far beyond anything architectural.

"Maya," I say.

"Don't." She's crying now, but quietly. The kind of crying that's practiced, efficient. "Don't tell me I was eighteen, don't tell me it was an impossible situation, don't tell me anyone would have made the same choice. Because they wouldn't have. Elena wouldn't have. You wouldn't have."

"You don't know what I would have done."

"Yes, I do. You would have helped Mrs. Rodriguez. Even if it meant losing the paintings, even if it meant losing everything else. Because that's who you are."

Maya looks at me with something that might be relief and might be despair. "Now you know. Now you know who I really am when everything fails."

I think about this. About Maya at eighteen, woken up in the middle of the night by disaster, given fifteen minutes to choose what mattered most. About the calculations she made in thirty seconds that have defined her understanding of herself for four years.

About the difference between who we think we are and who we become when the systems we depend on collapse completely.

"Maya," I say. "What if the choice you made doesn't define who you are? What if it defines who you were afraid of being?"

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, what if you've spent four years punishing yourself for revealing something about your character that you decided was unforgivable? But what if the thing you revealed wasn't selfishness—what if it was fear?"

Maya stops crying. Looks at me like I've said something in a language she's trying to translate.

"Fear of what?"

"Fear of losing the things that connected you to who you thought you were. Your family's history, your identity, your sense of belonging to something bigger than yourself." I pause, trying to find words for something I'm still figuring out as I say it. "Maybe you didn't choose objects over people. Maybe you chose known loss over unknown loss."

"That doesn't make it better."

"No. It doesn't make it better. But it makes it human."

We sit in silence for a while, listening to water move through spaces it doesn't belong. Maya wipes her face with the sleeve of her gray sweater, and I notice that her hands have stopped shaking.

"Dylan?" she says finally.

"Yeah?"

"Are you going to leave now? Now that you know?"

The question catches me off guard, not because I don't understand why she's asking, but because the answer is so clear I didn't realize it needed to be spoken.

"No," I say. "I'm not going to leave."

"Why?"

"Because you called me at three in the morning when you found water where it shouldn't be. Because you trusted me enough to tell me something you've never told anyone else. Because the person who made that choice in the flood isn't the person you are now."

"How do you know?"

"Because the person you are now studies environmental systems to understand how disasters happen. The person you are now calls me to fix windows because being alone with water damage is worse than admitting you need company. The person you are now is trying to learn how to make different choices."

Maya nods slowly, like she's considering whether to believe this.

"Also," I say, "because the person you are now is someone I—"

I stop. The word I almost said hangs between us like the water hanging in the air, waiting to fall.

"Someone you what?" Maya asks.

"Someone I want to keep knowing. All of you. Including the parts you think are unforgivable."

Maya looks at me for a long moment, and I can see her trying to decide whether to trust this. Whether to believe that someone can see the worst thing about her and choose to stay anyway.

"The basement's going to need pumping out," she says finally.

"Yeah. I'll call it in."

"And the equipment that got damaged—"

"Insurance will cover it. Or the university will replace it. These things can be fixed."

Maya nods. Stands up, brushes off her jeans. "I should probably go home. Elena's probably worried."

"Maya."

She stops.

"You can call me," I say. "Any time you find water where it shouldn't be. Literal or metaphorical. I'll come."

"Why?"

"Because showing up is what I do. And because you're worth showing up for."

Maya's face does something complicated, like she's trying to smile and cry at the same time.

"Even knowing what I chose?"

"Especially knowing what you choose now."

She walks up the stairs toward the exit, and I follow her. Outside, the rain has stopped, but the ground is saturated, storm drains backed up, water pooling in all the low places.

"Dylan?" Maya says as we reach our cars.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For listening. For staying."

"Thank you for trusting me with it."

Maya gets in her car and drives away, and I call the emergency line to report the flooding in Bren Hall. Then I sit in my truck for a while, thinking about choices made in rising water, about the difference between who we are and who we're afraid we might be.

About Maya, who has been living with the weight of one choice for four years, learning to carry it without letting it crush her completely.

About love, which isn't about finding someone perfect, but about finding someone whose imperfections make sense to you. Someone whose damage fits with your tools, whose brokenness you can work around without trying to fix.

I drive home through streets that are learning to carry more water than they were designed for, past buildings adapting to conditions they weren't built to handle.

Past all the small systems that keep functioning even when they're overwhelmed, even when they're asked to manage more than they can properly contain.

Like Maya, who has been functioning around her damage for four years. Not healed, not fixed, but functioning. Adapting. Surviving.

Like love, which doesn't require perfect people, just people willing to show up for each other when the systems fail.

I park behind Mrs. Henley's house and walk to my garage, where everything I own can be packed in fifteen minutes, where I've built a life that's mobile and minimal and prepared for the possibility that everything might need to be abandoned on short notice.

For the first time, I wonder what it would look like to build something that's designed to last. Something worth saving when the water rises.

Something worth staying for, even when staying is harder than leaving.

I think about Maya, calling me instead of the people whose job it is to handle emergencies. Trusting me with the story she's been carrying alone.

I think about showing up, which is what I do, and about staying, which is what I'm learning.
