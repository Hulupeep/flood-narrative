# Chapter 7 - Maya

The morning Dylan fixed the window that wasn't broken, I realized I had been preparing for the flood my entire life without knowing it.

Not the literal flood—though later, when the meteorologists tried to explain the "unprecedented atmospheric conditions" that created what they called a "thousand-year storm event," I would understand that unprecedented only means we haven't figured out how to predict it yet, not that it can't happen.

I mean the flood of truth. The moment when all the careful systems I'd built to contain who I really was would fail, and everything I'd been holding back would rush forward with the kind of force that reshapes landscapes permanently.

That morning in the library, watching Dylan work with his deliberate patience, I felt something shift in the architecture of my carefully constructed distance. The way he answered my question about fixing people—*people aren't broken windows*—made me realize I had been thinking about my own damage all wrong.

I had been trying to repair myself back to who I was before. But what if that person was the broken thing? What if the Maya who made choices like the one I made during the flood wasn't someone worth restoring?

I walked back to the apartment through rain that felt like practice for something heavier, and found Elena exactly where I'd left her: at the kitchen table with her laptop, surrounded by the archaeology of academic crisis. Coffee cups with sediment rings, printouts marked with highlighter, books splayed open like broken birds.

"How's the chapter revision going?" I asked, though I could tell from the way she was staring at the screen that the answer was not well.

"I think I need to scrap the whole thing and start over," Elena said. "Dr. Martinez is right—my methodology doesn't support my conclusions because my conclusions are based on what I wanted to find, not what the data actually shows."

She pushed the laptop away and rubbed her eyes. "I've been trying to prove that trauma creates resilience, that people who survive terrible things become stronger because of them. But the research doesn't support that. Most people who survive terrible things just... survive them. They adapt, but they don't become better. They just become different."

I sat down across from her, and the parallel was so obvious it felt like a physical weight settling on my shoulders. Elena studying trauma and resilience while living with someone who had survived something terrible. Me studying coastal erosion while trying to understand the forces that had carved away everything I thought I knew about myself.

"Maybe," I said carefully, "the question isn't whether people become better or worse after trauma. Maybe the question is whether they become more themselves."

Elena looked up from her laptop. "What do you mean?"

"I mean..." I searched for words that would tell the truth without revealing it. "Maybe trauma doesn't create new qualities in people. Maybe it just strips away everything that was covering up who they really were."

"That's terrifying."

"Yeah. It is."

Elena closed her laptop completely and looked at me with the kind of attention that meant she was thinking about something other than her dissertation. "Maya, can I ask you something?"

My entire body tensed. This was how conversations started that I couldn't finish, questions that led to places I couldn't follow without revealing the thing I'd been hiding for four years.

"Sure," I said, though I wasn't sure at all.

"That flood in Montecito, when you were in high school. You never talk about it."

"There's not much to say."

"But it was traumatic, right? Your family lost everything?"

Not everything, I thought. We lost most things. We lost the house and the furniture and my father's law books and my mother's studio. But we didn't lose everything. We lost Mrs. Rodriguez.

"It was bad," I said.

"But you all survived."

"We all survived."

Elena nodded like this confirmed something she'd been thinking. "I've been wondering if that's why you're so interested in environmental systems. Like, studying the thing that hurt you as a way of processing it."

The accuracy of her analysis made my chest tight. Elena was going to be a very good therapist someday, if she could learn to trust her insights instead of trying to prove them with data.

"Maybe," I said.

"Have you ever thought about talking to someone? About the flood?"

"I talk to you about it."

"I mean really talking. To a professional. Someone who could help you process the trauma."

I almost laughed. Elena thought my problem was unprocessed trauma, when actually my problem was trauma that had been processed with perfect clarity. I remembered every detail of that night, every choice, every consequence. The problem wasn't that I couldn't remember—it was that I remembered everything, including who I revealed myself to be when the systems failed.

"I'm fine," I said.

"Are you?"

The question hung between us like the smell of rain that was coming whether we wanted it or not. Outside, the sky was getting darker, the kind of gray that meant serious weather was developing offshore.

"Elena," I said. "What if someone did something during a trauma that they can't forgive themselves for? What if the thing that's traumatic isn't what happened to them, but what they did?"

Elena leaned forward, and I could see her shifting into the mode she used when she was analyzing research data. Trying to understand the variables, identify the patterns.

"What kind of thing?"

And there it was. The moment where I could either tell the truth or build another layer of protection around it. The choice I'd been making every day for four years, every time someone asked about the flood or noticed my anxiety around water or wondered why I studied coastal erosion with the intensity of someone trying to solve a personal equation.

I looked at Elena, who had been my closest friend for four years, who had lived with my nightmares and my strange phobias and my need to always know where the exits were. Who deserved to know who she'd been sharing space with all this time.

But I also looked out the window at the rain getting heavier, at the way water was already pooling in the low places between buildings, and I thought about what Dylan had said: *sometimes people don't need to be fixed—they need to be seen working around their damage.*

Elena was trying to fix me. Trying to help me process and heal and become the person I was supposed to be. But what if the person I was supposed to be was the person who made the choice I made? What if there was no healing from that, only learning to function around it?

"Nothing," I said. "Hypothetically."

Elena's expression shifted, and I could see her recognizing the retreat. The way I pulled back from honesty like touching something hot.

"Maya—"

"I should probably study," I said, standing up. "I have that coastal dynamics exam tomorrow."

"Maya, wait."

But I was already moving toward my bedroom, toward the safety of textbooks and scientific terminology and all the ways I'd learned to think about water as a system that could be understood and predicted, rather than a force that revealed truth with the kind of violence that changed everything permanently.

I spent the rest of the afternoon reading about debris flow formation, the specific combination of saturated soil and steep slopes and gravitational forces that creates the conditions for catastrophic failure. The technical language was soothing—*pore pressure*, *shear strength*, *critical threshold*. Ways of describing disaster that made it sound manageable, predictable, controllable.

But I also kept thinking about what Elena had said, about trauma stripping away everything that covered up who people really were. About the difference between surviving something and becoming stronger because of it.

I had survived the flood. But I hadn't become stronger. I had become someone who studied the thing that hurt her as a way of understanding herself, someone who called maintenance to fix windows that weren't broken because being alone with water damage was worse than admitting I needed company.

Someone who had revealed, when the systems failed, that she was the kind of person who would choose objects over people if the choice was framed correctly.

That night, I dreamed about the flood for the first time in months.

In the dream, I was standing in my mother's studio again, water rising around my ankles, eight watercolor paintings in my arms. But this time, I could hear Mrs. Rodriguez clearly. Not calling for help, but asking her last question: "Mija, are you safe?"

And I understood, even in the dream, that she hadn't been calling for rescue. She had been worried about me, standing in floodwater with my arms full of paintings, making a choice that would define who I was for the rest of my life.

In the dream, I tried to answer her. Tried to say that I wasn't safe, that none of us were safe, that safety was something we had all lost the moment the hillside started moving. But when I opened my mouth, only water came out.

I woke up with my sheets soaked in sweat and the sound of rain against my window. Real rain, not dream rain. The kind of steady precipitation that fills storm drains and saturates soil and creates the conditions for the ground to lose its grip on what it's trying to hold in place.

I got up and went to the kitchen for water, moving carefully in the dark so I wouldn't wake Elena. But she was already awake, sitting at the table with her laptop closed, looking out the window at the rain.

"Can't sleep either?" she asked.

"Bad dream."

"About the flood?"

I nodded, though she probably couldn't see me in the dark.

"Maya," Elena said. "Whatever happened during the flood, whatever you think you did or didn't do—you were eighteen. You were a kid in an impossible situation."

"I wasn't a kid."

"You were. And even if you made choices you regret, that doesn't define who you are now."

But she was wrong. The choice I made in my mother's studio, the thirty seconds I spent calculating the weight of paintings against the sound of Mrs. Rodriguez's voice—that was exactly what defined who I was. Not because it revealed something essential about my character, but because it taught me something essential about the distance between who I thought I was and who I actually was when the systems failed.

"Elena," I said. "What if the person you are in a crisis is the person you really are? What if everything else is just... performance?"

Elena was quiet for a long moment. Outside, the rain was getting heavier.

"Then I guess," she said finally, "the question is whether you want to keep being that person, or whether you want to learn to be someone different."

"And if you can't? If that's just who you are?"

"Then you find people who can love you anyway. Who see who you are and choose to stay."

I thought about Dylan, fixing windows that weren't broken because I needed the company more than I needed functional latches. Dylan, who had looked at me that morning and said people weren't windows, that when people break they find new ways to work.

Maybe Elena was right. Maybe the question wasn't whether I could forgive myself for the choice I made, or whether I could become someone who would have made a different choice. Maybe the question was whether I could find people who could see who I really was—the person who chose paintings over people when the water rose—and choose to stay anyway.

The rain kept falling. We sat in the dark kitchen, listening to water find its way to the lowest places, and I practiced telling the truth.

Not out loud. Not yet. But in my head, in the space between sleeping and waking, I practiced the words I would need someday:

*I heard Mrs. Rodriguez calling for help. I was standing in my mother's studio with eight paintings in my arms, and I heard her voice, and I chose to save the paintings instead of helping her. She died because I decided what my family's history was worth more than her future.*

The words felt like stones in my throat, too heavy to speak but too sharp to swallow.

But for the first time in four years, I could imagine saying them out loud. To Elena, who would try to help me understand and forgive myself. To Dr. Vance, who would help me analyze the psychological mechanisms that led to the choice. To my parents, who already knew what I had chosen but had never heard me acknowledge it.

To Dylan, who understood that people weren't broken windows, that when people break they don't stop working—they just find different ways to function.

The rain fell harder. I went back to bed and dreamed about water again, but this time, when Mrs. Rodriguez asked if I was safe, I found my voice.

"No," I said in the dream. "None of us are safe. But I'm here. I'm still here, and I'm trying to learn how to be different."

In the dream, she nodded like this was the answer she'd been waiting for.

"Good, mija," she said. "That's how you stay safe. Not by avoiding the flood, but by learning how to move through it."

I woke up crying, but for the first time since the flood, I wasn't crying from guilt. I was crying from something that felt almost like relief.

The rain was still falling when morning came, and the flood—the real flood, the one that would reshape everything again—was still twelve hours away.

But I had started practicing the words I would need to survive it.
