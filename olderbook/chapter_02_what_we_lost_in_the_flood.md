# Chapter 2 - Dylan

She's sitting in the far corner of Davidson Library's third floor, surrounded by textbooks that all look like they weigh more than she does. It's Tuesday morning, which means the academic crowds are somewhere else, and the building belongs to people like me and people like her—the ones who need quiet more than we need company.

I set up my ladder and try to be quieter about it.

I'm here to fix the heating vent that's been rattling since September. She's here to do whatever it is people do when they look like they're studying but their eyes never move across the page.

My tool cart makes more noise than I want it to, but she doesn't look up. I've been working buildings long enough to read the body language of don't disturb me, and hers is fluent. Shoulders hunched inward, coffee cup positioned like a barrier between her and the rest of the world, pen moving across notebook paper in patterns that don't look like note-taking.



The vent cover comes off easy—three screws, all of them loose from months of vibration. Inside, I find what I expected: a belt that's been slipping and a housing that's come loose from its moorings. Twenty-minute fix, if I don't have to stop and explain what I'm doing to curious students.

But she's not curious. She's writing, and from where I'm positioned on the ladder, I can see it's not academic work. The lines are too short, too broken. Poetry, maybe. Or lists. People make lists when they're trying to organize thoughts that don't want to stay organized.

I tighten the housing and replace the belt, working with the careful quiet you learn when your job is to fix things without disrupting the people who need them fixed. The rattling stops, but something else starts—a different kind of vibration, barely audible, coming from the direction of her table.

It takes me a minute to realize it's her foot, tapping against the chair leg in a rhythm that doesn't match any music I know.

When I climb down to test the thermostat, she finally looks up.

Her eyes are brown and careful, and they take inventory of me the way mine took inventory of the broken vent. Tool belt. Work boots. Hands that are clean but will never look like they've never held a wrench.

"Sorry," she says, though I haven't asked her to move or be quiet or stop existing in this space we're sharing. "Am I in your way?"

"No."

She waits for me to say more, but I don't. The thermostat is working now, and the air is already starting to move differently through the vents. My work here is finished.

Except I don't pack up my tools.

"You're here early," she says, still watching me with that careful attention.

"Best time. Before everyone else needs things."

"Right." She glances at her notebook, then closes it. "I mean, that makes sense. Getting things fixed before... before they break worse."

I nod, though I don't think that's what she meant to say. There's something about the way she talks—like she's translating from a language only she speaks, and the translation isn't quite right.

"You're maintenance?" she asks.

"Buildings and grounds."

"That's... that's a nice job."

Most people don't say that. Most people say "That's interesting" or "How long have you been doing that?" or they just nod and wait for the conversation to die a natural death. But she says it's nice, and she means it, and I find myself curious about what else she might mean that other people don't.

"I like fixing things," I say, which is more than I usually offer.

"What kinds of things?"

I consider this. "Mechanical things. Things with moving parts that are supposed to work together."

"Like people?"

The question comes out of nowhere, and for a second we both look surprised that she asked it. She blushes, which makes her look younger than the graduate student I took her for.

"No," I say. "People break differently."

She laughs, but it's not a happy sound. "Yeah. They do."

I should leave now. My work order is complete, and there are six other buildings on my list today. But something about her laugh makes me want to understand what broke it.

"You studying here often?" I ask.

"Most days. It's quiet."

"Yeah. Third floor gets the least traffic."

"You know the building pretty well."

"Been working here three years."

She nods like this explains something important. "Do you know all the buildings? On campus?"

"Most of them."

"That must be..." She stops, searches for the word. "Comprehensive."

Comprehensive. Like knowing the campus is a skill, not just a job requirement.

"You need a place to study?" I ask, surprising myself. "There's a spot in the Education building, fourth floor. No foot traffic, good natural light."

"Why are you telling me that?"

Good question. Why am I telling her that?

"You look like you need quiet," I say.

She stares at me for a long moment, and I have the feeling she's trying to solve a problem I don't know I've presented.

"Thank you," she says finally. "I'm Maya."

"Dylan."

"Dylan." She tests the name, like she's checking its fit. "Are you a student here?"

"No."

"Right. You said maintenance." She's fidgeting with her pen now, clicking it open and closed. "Have you always... I mean, is this what you wanted to do?"

Another question I don't usually get. Most people assume you end up in maintenance because other things didn't work out, and they're usually too polite to ask about the didn't work out part.

"I wanted to build things," I say. "Turns out I'm better at fixing them."

"Same skill set?"

"Related."

She nods like this makes perfect sense, and I realize I've been standing here for ten minutes talking to a stranger about my job. This is not normal behavior for me.

"I should let you get back to your studying," I say.

"Right. Yes." But she doesn't open her notebook. "Dylan?"

"Yeah?"

"The heating thing you fixed. How did you know what was wrong with it?"

"Experience. Process of elimination."

"But how do you learn that? The experience part."

I look at her more carefully. The question feels important to her in a way that has nothing to do with HVAC systems.

"You start with what you can see," I say. "What's obviously wrong. Then you work backward to what might be causing it."

"What if nothing's obviously wrong? What if it just... doesn't work right?"

Now we're definitely not talking about heating vents.

"That's harder," I admit. "Sometimes you have to take things apart to see what's really broken."

She nods slowly, like I've confirmed something she already suspected.

"That sounds scary," she says.

"Yeah. It is."

We look at each other across the space between her table and my tool cart, and I have the strange feeling we've just had two conversations at the same time.

"I should go," I say.

"Right. Thank you for... for fixing the heat."

"Just doing my job."

But as I pack up my tools, know that's not entirely true. Could have fixed the vent and left without saying a word. That would have been just doing my job.

This was something else.

I'm halfway to the elevator when she calls after me.

"Dylan?"

I turn back.

"That place you mentioned. In the Education building. What floor?"

"Fourth. Room 4220. There's a corner by the windows."

"Thank you."

The elevator takes forever to come, and while I wait, I can hear her gathering her things. Books sliding into a bag, chair scraping against floor, footsteps moving toward the stairwell.

When the elevator finally arrives, it's empty except for the reflection of someone who looks like me but who just spent twenty minutes having a conversation with a stranger instead of moving on to the next work order.

I don't know what to make of that.

Rest of my day is routine. Broken door handle in Physics building. Flickering fluorescent in Student Union. Clogged drain in Arts building—someone tried to fix with Drano and made worse.

Normal problems with normal solutions.

Keep thinking about Maya. The way she asked about fixing things that aren't obviously broken. About the rhythm her foot was keeping against chair leg. How it didn't sound like music.

That evening, sit in my apartment with a notebook I bought three years ago and never used. Write:

*She asked about fixing things that don't look broken.
Told her you have to take them apart first.
See what's really wrong.

But didn't tell her the scary part—
sometimes taking things apart
is what breaks them for good.

Sometimes the thing that's wrong
is that someone already tried to fix it.*

Close the notebook. Put it in the drawer with my other notebooks. Been filling them for years but never show anyone. Poetry, I guess. Don't call it that. Just observations. Things I notice that other people don't seem to see.

Things like:
Maya is afraid of something that hasn't happened yet.

Things like:
She writes in her notebook the way people pray.
Like she's hoping someone's listening
but not sure anyone is.

Things like:
I want to know what broke her.
Afraid the wanting
will make me do something stupid.

Outside my window, campus settles into evening quiet. Lights coming on in dorm rooms. Students heading to dinner or study groups or whatever they do when they're not sitting alone in libraries, surrounded by books they're not really reading.

Make myself a sandwich. Eat it standing at the kitchen counter. Looking out at the place where I spend my days fixing things for people who mostly don't notice I exist.

Except today, someone noticed.

Today, someone asked questions that made me think about the difference between building and fixing. Between what's obviously broken and what just doesn't work right.

Don't know what to make of that yet.

But I wrote it down.

Writing things down—that's how I figure out what they mean.

Tomorrow there will be new work orders. New problems to solve. New systems that need the kind of attention only someone like me knows how to give.

Maybe, if I'm in Davidson Library around the same time, I'll see if Maya found her way to room 4220.

Maybe I'll ask her what she was writing in that notebook she closed so quickly.

Maybe I'll learn what language she's translating from. Whether she needs someone who's better at fixing things than breaking them.

The thought should scare me more than it does.

Should scare me as much as taking things apart
to see what's really wrong with them.

But it doesn't.

Not sure what to make of that, either.
