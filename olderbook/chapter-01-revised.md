# Chapter 1: What Returns

## Maya (Past Tense)

I told myself I wouldn't come back to Santa Barbara. But promises to yourself are just—I think maybe they're just ways of mapping where the fault lines are. Like how geologists mark where the earth will break next time. Not if. When.

The UCSB campus lagoon still smells wrong. Even after six years. Even after they dredged it twice and installed those new drainage systems Dylan probably maintains now. Water has memory, my Environmental Science professor used to say, though she meant it differently. She meant molecular structures. Chemical bonds. Not the way water remembers what it carried away.

I park in Lot 10 because my body remembers the walk to Davidson Library better than my mind remembers why I'm here. Muscle memory. Like drowning.

*The water came so fast that night—stop.*

My hands find the scar on my palm before I realize I'm tracing it again. Twenty-three stitches. The ER doctor said I was lucky the glass didn't hit any tendons. I didn't tell him I grabbed the broken window frame on purpose. That I needed something sharp enough to cut through the kindness of strangers telling me everything would be okay.

## Dylan (Present Tense)

She's back.

I see her from the library's third-floor mechanical room. Same walk—weight on her heels like she's always bracing for impact. But her hair's different. Shorter. Shows her neck now.

I shouldn't remember her neck.

Check the water pressure gauge: 45 psi. Normal. Check the air handler filters: need changing Tuesday. Check the woman crossing the plaza: still moving like she's underwater.

Some people change after trauma. Get harder or softer or find religion or whatever. Maya Chen just got more precisely herself. Like pressure compressed her into some denser version, all excess burned away.

I write in my maintenance log: *3rd floor AHU filter replacement scheduled.* 
I write in my other notebook: *She still counts her steps.*

Fourteen steps from the bike path to the library entrance. She used to count them out loud when she thought no one was listening. Now her lips move but no sound comes out.

## Maya (Past Tense)

The reference desk hasn't moved. Same industrial carpet that smells like decades of coffee spills and freshman anxiety. But the librarian is new—young, maybe a grad student, with the kind of eager helpfulness that makes me want to lie.

"I'm looking for the Special Collections archived newspapers from 2018," I say, and the words come out steadier than I feel. "Specifically January ninth through fifteenth."

She doesn't flinch at the dates. Too young to remember, probably. Wasn't here when the rain started. When the hills came down. When we all learned that fifteen minutes is enough time to lose everything. Or almost everything. Or—

"Are you researching the Montecito mudslides?" she asks, fingers already flying over her keyboard. "We have a whole disaster archive section now. Dr. Martinez in Environmental Studies actually compiled—"

"Just the newspapers." My voice cracks like a fault line. "Please."

## Dylan (Present Tense)

Watch her hands shake as she signs the archive request form. 

She's left-handed now. Wasn't before.

The thing about maintaining buildings: you learn to spot structural damage. Hairline cracks in load-bearing walls. Foundations shifting one millimeter at a time. Water finding its way through invisible spaces.

The thing about Maya: she's all hairline cracks now.

I should go back to work. Got a service call about the elevator in North Hall. But I watch her follow the librarian to Special Collections instead. Count her steps: twenty-three. She stumbles on seventeen.

Pull out my notebook:
*January 9th - She's here for the anniversary  
Different hand (left)  
Same counting  
Still drowning on dry land*

## Maya (Past Tense)

The newspapers smell like time. Like things preserved past their expiration date. The librarian leaves me in the climate-controlled reading room with cotton gloves and unnecessary warnings about proper handling. As if I haven't held fragile things before. As if I haven't watched them dissolve.

January 9, 2018. Front page: "STORM APPROACHES SANTA BARBARA COUNTY."

My hands autopilot to my scar. The water rises in my chest, salt and sediment and—

*Elena's hand in mine. The walls groaning. Twenty-three minutes from first warning to impact. Should have been enough time. Would have been, if—*

"I'm sorry," I tell the empty room. Practice for later. For the conversation I came back to have. "I'm so sorry."

## Dylan (Present Tense)

The archive reading room has three exits. Main door. Emergency exit. Service corridor that connects to the mechanical spaces.

She doesn't know about the third one.

Position myself behind the HVAC unit where I can see through the ventilation grate. Not spying. Just... checking the air circulation. That's all. Nothing wrong with making sure the climate control works properly in Special Collections.

She's reading the same article for the third time. Lips moving with the words I know by heart: "Flash flooding and debris flows devastated the Montecito area, leaving 23 dead and dozens missing..."

Watch her left hand cramp around the pencil as she copies something into a notebook. Her right hand stays flat on the table. Protecting the scar.

## Maya (Past Tense)

The room is too quiet. Just the hum of climate control and my breathing that I can't quite regulate. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Like Dr. Patel taught me. Like drowning in reverse.

I find what I came for on page A6. Below the fold, like tragedy becomes less important with distance from the headlines.

"Local Woman, 22, Dies Saving Neighbor's Children"

Elena Rodriguez. They spelled her name wrong—Rodriguez with a 'z' instead of an 's' like she preferred. She was particular about that. Particular about everything, really. How towels should be folded (thirds, then half). How coffee should be made (seventeen seconds of bloom time). How friends should be honest with each other about—

The water rises higher. Salt in my throat.

*"Maya, we need to go." Elena's voice through the apartment door. Calm. Always so calm. "Maya, please."*

*But I was trying to save the paintings. My mother's paintings that I'd promised to protect. Wrapped in plastic, stacked in the closet, worth nothing to anyone but us.*

*"Just one more minute—"*

*The sound when the debris hit. Like the earth swallowing itself.*

## Dylan (Present Tense)

She runs for the emergency exit.

Slams into the door hard enough to trigger the alarm. Then she's gone, leaving behind an open newspaper and the echo of a sound I've never heard her make before. Like drowning. Like surfacing. Like both at once.

I should reset the alarm. File an incident report. Get back to the elevator in North Hall.

Instead, I walk to the table. Read the article she circled in pencil. Elena Rodriguez. Remember her—quiet girl from Isla Vista who worked at the campus bookstore. Always smiling at people's textbook complaints. Gone at 22.

Maya's notebook lies open beside the newspaper. One line, written over and over in her new left-handed scrawl:

*I chose the paintings.*

The water damage in this building runs deeper than anyone wants to admit. Some floods you can't drain. Some structures fail from the inside out. Some things break so precisely along existing fault lines that you can't tell what was weak before and what the water made weak.

But broken things still function sometimes. Just differently.

Just more carefully.

Just counting every step.
